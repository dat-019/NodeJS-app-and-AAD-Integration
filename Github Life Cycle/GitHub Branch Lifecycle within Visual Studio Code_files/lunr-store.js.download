        "excerpt":" Airline SOA tools and capabilities are deployed in a multi-tenant, software as a service (SaaS) model. In this model, all software and middleware products are leveraged across multiple Applications (business products) and multiple clients.  When inducting new clients or new products into the platform, new licenses are generally not required and the product is added to the existing capability footprint, resulting in lower start up cost and usage of an existing production proven platform.Naturally, this platform is calibrated to a certain capacity such as 10G Ethernet network, 16 core Oracle footprint, 2000 message per second security gateway and so on, with all components being horizontally scalable.  As part of induction of any new client / product, the product manager will assess the baseline footprint to determine if any component needs to be scaled based on the client volume and the products performance requirements; and the appropriate costs are included in the point of sale model which is later aligned with any necessary procurement.Airline SOA products and capabilities are aligned to DXC hardware and software, and also aligned with DXC strategic partners. All procurement is handled through ITO procurement and aligned to existing Master Services Agreements for each vendor where applicable.Contacts:Product/Operations Manager: Pasha CamposCritical Ops Support: ATC-Advanced Transportation CoverageProduction Support: AirlineSOA PS","categories": ["Airline - Consumer Travel"],

        "excerpt":"Some pointers for people starting their digital journey... This article is intended for users that want to become more digital, but are not sure where to start.1. Admit you have a problemIf you’ve been doing the same thing the same way for a long time, there is probably a better way. If you are still using waterfall, there is probably a better way. If you spend a lot of time doing the same manual tasks, there is probably a better way. If your current release or approval cycle takes months, there is probably a better way.2. Focus on the journey more than the destinationDigital is as much of a state of mind as it is technology based, so it is more than switching the underlying technology you work with. You need to adjust the way people work - adopt agile practices, think about DevOps, inner source, look for opportunities to leverage or automate …You can shoot for the moon, but do not forget the journey. There is a reason it is called ‘Digital Transformation’ - it is a paradigm shift that requires behavioural changes - e.g., adopting agile practices; design thinking, implementing continuous integration as the first step to DevOps, adopting test driven development methods; using markdown for documents rather than Word… It is so much more than just changing the tools in your tool box.Resources:  Complete the Digital Foundation badge  Take some Agile Training3. Take responsibilityEveryone should take responsibility for learning and becoming more familiar with digital practices and behaviour, otherwise you may get left behind.Resources:  Review info for Core Domains in TIPS (Agile, DevOps, etc.)  Check our Quick Videos4.

        "title": "Why I like GitHub",
        "excerpt":"Just a few of reasons why I like using GitHub... This article is intended for users that are not sure if and how GitHub could be useful to them with their day to day work. To many GitHub is seen only as a tool to version control source code. Hopefully we can convince everyone that it is more than that and can provide value in many different scenarios and benefit all types of users - it is not just the domain of developers.  To do this we shall compare and contract GitHub with other common office productivity tools, that most people would be familiar with.FeaturesScalabilityIt doesn’t matter if you are a team of 1 or 100 or many more than that, GitHub can work for you.GitHub uses containers called repositories (or repos) to store content, i.e., files, issues, wikis, etc. These can be standalone, i.e., owned by a specific user, or can be grouped under an organization. An organization can contain many repositories within its domain. Access to these repositories can be controlled by assigning individual users access to the repository or groups can be created at the organization level and then these can be assigned at the repository level to grant all users in that group access to the repository.So a single user who wants to manage and share content within GitHub, can create a repository. Teams with more complex requirements can create an organization and as many subordinate repositories as needed, while controlling access as whatever granularity is required.You can also manage issues at the organization level using kanban boards (called project boards), hold team level discussions, and more. GitHub also supports tagging of repositories, making them easier to find for users doing searches at the enterprise level. Fostering a much higher potential of reuse and collaboration.Compare: SharePoint provides the ability to create sites and sub-sites and control permissions at all levels, but the user experience is more disjointed and tends to be more stove-piped.Videos:  Organizations and Repositories-&gt; Top Version ControlGitHub is a version control tool for source code… Why would other users need it, SharePoint and One Drive both support versioning and this is a valid point. In many scenarios, these are the optimal solutions. Where GitHub is different is that it provides more flexibility and maintains better audit control, specifically for text-based non-proprietary content.What you can also do in GitHub is:  Create snapshots of content (called releases), for example, to identify all the appropriate versions of different content associated with a specific milestone. For example, all the collateral linked with a specific project or product milestone. So you can always go back and see earlier versions of specific items and the associated versions of other related items for a specific milestone.  Easily manage multiple replicas of the same content. For example, to separate draft content from approved versions, to make it very easy for users to identify the last approved version of the item while content updates are in progress. This can be invaluable if you are updating work instructions, where users are relying on the availability of an earlier version while content is in the process of being enhanced.GitHub provides the ability to manage the replicas (called branches) and easily synchronize any changes across each branch when needed. It can also created tagged copies (called releases) to track content based on major milestones.Additionally, as GitHub is  predicated on the principles of ‘crowd collaboration’ - think how Microsoft releases betas so users can provide ‘free’ testing services… It provides the option to allow DXC users outside of your immediate team to create their own replica of content (called a fork), update this content, and then submit a request (called a pull request) to potentially incorporate (merge) these enhancements into the master copy. So, you can take advantage of the expertise and experience of any and all users in DXC to advance your content…Compare: Where OneDrive or SharePoint are the better solution, is where online simultaneous collaboration is required for Office files, e.g., Excel, Word, etc. For example, multiple users can work simultaneously on Word documents stored in a shared OneDrive and see each others changes near real-time. This is not an option with GitHub, which provides the ability to store and version these types of files, but not to support simultaneous edits or merging of updates.Where SharePoint or OneDrive are not as effective is the crowd sourcing capability, you either have to provide edit access all users or manually combine updates as they are provided.Videos:  GitHub Management Best Practices  Forks, Clones and Branches  Baselines-&gt; Top GitHub IssuesGitHub provides simple light-weight project tracking (called Issues). This is ideal for defining a simple backlog.This includes support to create new labels and milestones based on your teams’s needs. Labels and milestone provide a lightweight mechanism to track and filter your backlog items. For example, you can use labels to differentiate between bugs and enhancements, to prioritize - high, medium and low, to identify user stories, etc. You can use milestones to associate an issue with a specific sprint, release or project phase.You can also break down the activities for a specific issue, to track progress based on the sub-tasks. This is as easy as markdown! You can also assign issues to up to 10 users to work on, you can undertake discussion threads and assign issues to kanban boards (called project boards). Additionally, GitHub provides integrated change management, i.e., the ability to track content change directly to the request that triggered the change. This in done by cross referencing the issue ID (prefixed with text ‘resolves’ or ‘fixes’) in the commit comment in GitHub when updating content. GitHub then creates the link that builds the intrinsic traceability between the commit and the issue.Compare: SharePoint lists and forms can be configured to track changes, but this is not intrinsic to the tool and does not have the feature set that is out of the box with GitHub. MS Planner and Trello have similar abilities as GitHub issues, but do not provide integrated change management, plus Trello has a cost associated with it. Jira provides this ability and more, but can be more complex than is required by some teams and has to be configured to integrate with GitHub for traceability.Videos:  Issues, Pull Requests and Projects  Managing a Backlog using Issues-&gt; Top  GitHub ProjectsGitHub provides a simple kanban facility (called projects boards) where you can create a simple board view that shows the status of your issues based on user-defined states.You can use one of the standard templates when creating a new GitHub project or start from a blank board. You can then adjust or add columns as needed. You also have the option to associate columns to specific automation flows, e.g., associate all new issues to a specific status as they are assigned to the project.Issues are then added to the project board by assigning the issue to that project within the issue itself or can be added by dragging and dropping from the Add Cards tab in the project board. From the project board you can see the assigned users for each issue, the activity status where a breakdown is provided and the labels associated with the issues. You can open an issue from the board, by clicking on the title to see more detail or make updates, and progress the issue across the board through drag and drop.At the top of the board, you can optionally track the overall status of the issues associated with the board through a progress status bar. You can also filter the project board, e.g., based on milestone, label, etc.Compare: MS Planner and Trello have similar abilities as GitHub issues, but do not provide integrated change management, plus Trello has a cost associated with it. Jira provides this ability and more, but can be more complex than is required by some teams and has to be configured to integrate with GitHub for traceability.Videos:  Issues, Pull Requests and Projects  Managing a Backlog using Issues-&gt; Top  GitHub WikisGitHub provides the ability for users to create simple wiki pages to share simple content using markdown. This could be used for simple process documents, work aids, role descriptions, etc.By using markdown, you remove the focus on format, so users can concentrate on content. It also makes them easier to view updates and collaborate on content because it is text-based content, and therefore much easier to merge updates from multiple sources.GitHub wikis provide users a home page for basic information and navigation, and then the ability to create sub-pages as needed. A standard footer can be defined, for copyright, standard links, etc. There is also a simple text box on the right, where you could create a table of content or define a set of useful links. It is very simple to set up, can be cloned and worked on offline and provides the same versioning you see in any other GitHub repository.Compare: SharePoint and MS Teams provide the ability to create simple pages and both are tightly integrated with other Office 365 applications. The advantage of GitHub wikis is that they are embedded with the other features of GitHub, so perfect for making work instructions immediately and easily available to users using other features in the tool. You can also work on the content offline.Videos:  GitHub Wikis-&gt; Top  GitHub PagesGitHub provides static web hosting, supporting markdown and html, and is a great way to create some good looking pages. To make it easier, you can clone and tailor others sites, based on GitHub’s ease of reuse.This is a really easy way to create an window into you team for other users. This helps communicate to your team, e.g., events, key processes, road maps, where to find support, anything you like. It is an easy alternative to web hosting from SharePoint, is more engaging than OneNote and becoming more popular with cross-functional teams.The TIPS site is a great way to find out more about available tools and capabilities, but that is not the best part! We have worked hard to make it easier for you to clone it and reuse to create your OWN pages. OurSite provides the source for our pages. It leverages the Minimal Mistakes theme (called remotely), so that it automatically pulls upgrades and fixes for the theme automatically - check out the new search feature!!! This is a great example of inner sourcing within DXC and there are many familiar examples of sites, where teams have used this template as the basis for their content - check out the NOLA DTC site…There are other templates available - check it out…Compare: SharePoint provides the ability to create web pages and is more feature rich in this perspective than GitHub. The advantage of GitHub pages is that you can easily clone or fork and tailor an existing site. The pages are also embedded with the other features of GitHub, so great for providing background on your team and the work you do, providing collaboration instructions, possibilities of reuse, team guidelines - the options are endless.Videos:  GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages - Automation-&gt; Top   Real Examples - Using GitHubThe following sections provide some real examples of how GitHub can be used outside of its traditional code versioning capability.-&gt; Top   Create a simple web siteDo you want to create an easy web presence? GitHub pages allow you do that very quickly!The TIPS was created from ground up using the Minimal Mistakes remote theme in a few days. By providing guidance for replication, other users should be able to recreate this framework for their own use in less than an hour? As more users build more sites, the options for leveraging that content are endless….There are more than 30 forks created from this site and another replica site, including the one shown above. It has provided a really fast way for teams to create their web presence, rather than building from scratch in SharePoint.Other examples of teams using this:  Platform DXC ServiceNow Development Studio  Unix Capability  Test Automation Practice”  Newcastle DTC-&gt; Top   Host support contentDo you want to create guidance documents or usage guides? We host all our on-line enablement collateral out of GitHub in our SME Enablement Library. This includes blogs, quick videos, session recordings and more. The content if mostly markdown, with some html, css, images, etc.By migrating to GitHub, we can now manage the files in the same location we publish. Previously, we used Subversion to manage the content and SharePoint for publication. This has eliminated significant time, effort and complexity and also almost completely eliminated potential failure points in this process. We also now have automated spell checks and links checks, so quality has improved.Other examples of teams using this:  Platform DXC &amp; Bionix documentation template  DevCloud  Azure Task Force Automation  AET Achievements-&gt; Top   Create, review and host simple document contentDo you have a series of simple processes, work instructions, guidelines you want to make easily available? Wikis are perfect for this and very easy to maintain.If you are reading this, you are looking at one example. There are any others, as shown in the screen shot below taken from the Platform DXC organization.-&gt; Top  SummaryGitHub is the inner source / open source center of DXC. It provides the ability for teams to securely store and protect their content, while at the same time allowing any user to draft and propose changes to content or potentially leverage content to address their own needs.GitHub provides the ability for team members to contribute directly to content within a repository, by creating their own branch, creating a pull request once the content is ready for review and then for the owner to use that pull request to manage the review of that content and the synchronization or merge of that content if approved.All teams are strongly encouraged to use GitHub to host, manage and maintain their content in GitHub to encourage broader collaboration and reuse of content within specific teams and also with users outside a specific organization.For anyone that wants to get their feet web and just start learning about GitHub by using it - GitHub is accessible to all DXC users and is available at no cost to end users. This includes an environment where teams can collaborate with external partners or customers. GitHub already has a very large user base and there are lots of resources to help people get started.More info… Getting Started with GitHub-&gt; Top","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"Learn to swim with documentation as code... You have probably been bombarded with jargon - feel overwhelmed by technology - feeling like you need a PhD from MIT to keep up. It’s not true, you need to be open-minded, you need to be willing to learn and you need to be curious and a little adventurous.One area where many are either nervous or unwilling to test the waters is the idea of documentation as code. Narrowly speaking this is the concept of treating your text content, your documentation, in the same way you would your code. In broader terms, the mechanics may be focused on terms and tools that have traditionally been the domain of our techie colleagues, but the real benefits are that these solutions provide a better user experience for your audience, they have inherent potential to re-use and leverage common content and resolve quality issues that are prevalent with more traditional documentation options (read more - Why bother with documentation as code?).Learn to swimSo we want to help you get your feet wet. How we are doing this is by creating environments where users can see working examples and learn about options for getting started with these concepts, plus providing play areas where users can get some practice.Many people learn best by tinkering, so taking something that is already setup and pulling it apart. Others prefer more instructions, or learn best by watching others. With the sample sites - you can have it all.There are currently 2 rides in our water park :smile: :  The ‘Web’ Experience  The ‘Library’ ExperienceThe ‘Web’ ExperienceClick here to get a fast pass.This takes you on journey to the island of Jekyll, riding on the Minimal Mistakes vessel. An exciting adventure of markdown, pages, posts and more. In other words, you can learn how to generate a web site hosted using GitHub pages, based on simple markdown content. You’ll find examples of pages, presentations, diagrams and documents on your journey. However, this adventure is more suited for teams looking to create an online presence for others to learn about what they are doing, to share information, to educate - more like a traditional website.The ‘height’ requirements for this adventure, mean that you’ll need a little familiarity with some of the concepts included - so expect to spend a little more time on this one. But don’t get discouraged, there are many that have already been on this ride and some even bought the t-shirt.The ‘Library’ ExperienceClick here to get onboard.Climb aboard and enjoy the cruise to the land of MkDocs. This is a more sedate journey - no height requirements. You’ll see similar sights and landmarks - examples of pages, presentations, diagrams and documents on your journey. A great starting point for anyone that is trying to find their sea legs or learning to swim. A simple option, intuitive navigation, scalable depending on how much luggage you have.Earn your water-wingsOnce you have your feet wet - you dive in and earn your water wings by incorporating your own content.If you are still a little nervous - you can join us in the paddling pool - our playground. This is a communal area where you can contribute your own content. Learn how to create a presentation, try creating a document or a diagram - the world is your splash pad. Get started here.Alternatively, if you are feeling more adventurous there are templates that you can fork and then go wild:  OurSite - build your own web experience  MkDocs - build your own libraryInstructions for replication and customization are embedded within the templates.Don’t be afraid of the waterEven if you don’t want to - try it.

        "title": "Documents and Superheros...",
        "excerpt":"Find out more about how MkDocs can help you define your 'content library as code'... MkDocs is the newest addition to our stable of documentation as code Superheros. A simple option that is ideal to use as the framework to create a ‘library as code’. It is designed to manage content across different topics areas and including different types of media, i.e., documents, presentations, diagrams and pages. It is a real Superhero - read more about it’s Super Powers…(and just for fun - guess the Superhero for each section …)Sharing - leverage rather than replicate common content            Super Power #1 …      Guess Who?                  Dealing with common content that is used across multiple documents is always a potential problem. Typically this is copied and pasted into each document, so hard-coded. If it needs to be updated, those changes must be made in every document where the content has been included - this becomes a maintenance issue. If that process fails - there is inconsistency.The MkDocs template has been set up so that you can define content once and then just cross-reference wherever it needs to be included using a simple tag. This can be done in documents and for slides in presentations. You can even define variable content, either globally or per page, allowing specific terms easily updated on a global basis, e.g., a contact name that may appear in multiple places, but can be changeable.            Simplicity - focus on content over format            Super Power #2 …      Guess Who?                  How many of us have found we focus more time formatting content and less on building content?The MkDocs template is defined using markdown, which supports basic formatting, headings, bullets, bold, italics, tables, but you no longer have to fight with sections, headers/footers, orphans and all the formatting related specifically to the printed page. Most documents are never printed, so why waste time. If you do need to print - the template supports that, but it is not the focus.Where more complex formatting is required, the template also supports html, so you can still do things like change font colours, but it is the exception rather than the rule!            Auditability - better tracking and version control            Super Power #3 …      Guess Who?                  Imagine no longer having to maintain a record of amendments!Version control is inherent in tools like GitHub, you don’t need manual processes to track changes. Every update is tracked down to the specific paragraphs, words and characters that were changed. This should pass the most stringent audit.Additionally, you have the option of using issues to track the reason for making changes in a more formal way, where you include the perpetrator, the motive, required reviewers &amp; approvals and link this to the actual changes - no more tracking spreadsheets, email threads in Outlook or marked up documents.There is also the ability to automatically embed the latest edit date on each document - so users can easily see if content has been edited recently, directly from the page view.            Orchestration - Shorter/faster route from creator to consumer            Super Power #4 …      Guess Who?                  With documentation as code, you also get the ability to automate the processing of your content - ensuring a consistent publication approach, and can potentially embed validation checks to ensure quality.Currently, the sample environment is configured so that updates are automatically deployed, i.e., published, when committed - the focus here is on speed not quality. However, quality checks, such as spell checks and link checks can be included, so that every update is subject to these checks as they are deployed - imagine no more typos and broken links. You can further control that, so content cannot be deployed unless these checks pass, or even require a review from an authorized user prior to deployment, so you can ensure the appropriate approvals are applied and tracked. Much of this can be accomplished with some simple changes to settings in GitHub.

        "excerpt":"Find out how easy it is to format your content with markdown... In this blog, you will see examples of the basic markdown formatting to help you get started. Click here to see the raw markdown, which includes embedded hidden comments that describe the syntax used. Alternatively check out the presentation at the bottom of this blog to see a description of the different syntax. Markdown supports embedded images.What is Markdown?Markdown supports up to 6 levels of headings.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. - WikipediaMarkdown supports blockquote, allowing you to indent and emphasize text - typically used for quotes.Unlike other tagging languages, like HTML and RTF, Markdown allows the content to be easily read, even in its base form, i.e., without rendering. If you have ever viewed the source HTML for a web page, you can see that markdown has a huge advantage in its simplicity. Markdown is also portable, in that it is widely consumed - you’ll see it in many of our tools, e.g., Workplace, GitHub.Click here to see a history of markdown.Markdown supports hyperlinks.Formatting OptionsMarkdown is simple syntax that is used to designate formatting for text-based content. This is then interpreted by a tool, like GitHub, and rendered as formatted text. This is not something new - most content you see is at its basic level some type of text-based tagged content, including Word…Format options include:  headings  bulleted &amp; numbered lists  embedded images  hyperlinks  tables  text emphasis, e.g.,          bold      italics…      Markdown supports bulleted lists.BenefitsAlthough it can take little time to adjust to using markdown, there are many benefits for making this shift.  Users can focus on content over format  Simple syntax is easy to learn  Portable across different tools  Supports publication to different mediums, e.g.,          HTML      PDF        Options to automate quality checks  Improved search within and across contentMarkdown supports numbered lists and mixed lists.Markdown EditorsThere are many markdown editors available - many of which are free. We have focused on VS Code, Notepad++ and Atom, and found VS Code most useful supporting the standard templates created.

        "title": "Our Journey to Documentation as Code...",
        "excerpt":"Learn all about the journey to documentation as code and why we started it in the first place... We went through 4 stages in this journey, to get to where we are now.  We started in what we call our Jurassic Period - blindly created documents because we knew they were needed.  Next, we went to the Dark Ages - we know there was something better we should be doing, but hadn’t found it.  The third stage was our Renaissance - this is when we truly started to adopt documentation as code practices.  The stage we are currently in, our Space Age, is automating our processes, to improve quality and efficiency.            Jurassic Period      Dark Ages                                          Renaissance      Space Age                              Read the rest of our blog to find out more about our journey…Jurassic - 2006 - Starting with MS Word (Dinosaurs)Users wanted comprehensive documentation, but complained the document was too long…We mitigated this by adding cross-reference links between sections and creating an index. The StarTeam Usage Model (200 pages) and Change Management Reference Guide (150 pages) were prime examples of the content we managed at this time as Global Tooling SMEs.Links were manually verified through work product review and spell checks performed based on manual procedures. Content was stored in SharePoint.Dark Ages - 2007 - PDF (Taming the Beast)To improve user experience, content was converted to PDF as part of the publication process. This required a thirteen step manual procedure to ensure integrity of conversion and retention of all links. These instructions had to be completed in the order given and exactly as specified.Improvements included the automatic generation of bookmarks, to provide persistent linked table of contents accessible from bookmarks tab. This allowed users to ‘bounce’ more easily from one section to another in the document. Cross references were also added, which were converted to hyperlinks in the PDF format - allowing users to bounce between related content.Links were manually verified through work product review and spell checks performed based on manual procedures. Content continued to be stored in SharePoint.Renaissance - 2012 - Adobe RoboHelp (Rebirth)Documents were getting longer and more difficult to maintain and we realized that users found it easier to ask us a question than go and this. Conversion required breaking up the documents into logical sections, converting Word content to HTML and creating logical functional breakdown for table of contents/navigation. An example converted document: ALM Usage Model - 640+ images, 420+ topics.The conversion meant that users now only consumed content in ‘pocket-sized’ topics, with links at bottom leading to more detail if needed. Content was fully indexed, provided advanced search capability. Navigation provided through persistent menu/table of contents. Content could be published in multiple formats, e.g., Word, PDF, Flash-Help, etc.Internal links were validated automatically within RoboHelp - this included index, cross-reference and table of contents links. External links continued to be manually verified through work product review and spell checks performed based on manual procedures. Source content now stored in StarTeam/Subversion and published content hosted in SharePoint.Space - 2018 - GitHub (Moving Up)Version control continued to be problematic, specifically when more than one person worked on content. Publication to SharePoint took hours and was problematic.To resolve the issue we migrated our source files to GitHub, which provides a better experience for working collaboratively. At the same time, we started using the GitHub static web hosting capability to publish the content, which resolved all issues we had experienced with SharePoint and sped up the process exponentially.For quality checks, we now have the ability to create pipelines to automate spell checks and link checks.SummaryWe no longer user Word for content. We are starting to create presentations using js.reveal rather than PowerPoint - although we still use this for graphics. Our ecosystem has moved almost entirely to GitHub - with TIPS and SME Central both hosted through GitHub. We have moved almost all of our content from SharePoint to GitHub.We work more effectively with more of team working concurrently on content - we are no longer single-threaded. We also have seen the collaboration with the wider community increase. The user experience has improved, as the quality has improved, but as the content is now responsive, you can consume from PC screen or the smaller screen on a phone.We have pipelines in place to automate spell checks, link checks and general syntax checks - so we no longer have to manually validate links or remember to execute spell checksCheck out the presentationYou can also view this content is presentation mode… and guess what - this is also generated from documentation as code!

        "title": "MkDocs - Content Library - Getting Started...",
        "excerpt":"Create your own content library with GitHub pages and MkDocs - follow this quick start guide to learn more... MkDocs is the newest addition to our stable of documentation as code Superheros. A simple option that is ideal to use as the framework to create a ‘library as code’. It is designed to manage content across different topics areas and including different types of media, i.e., documents, presentations, diagrams and pages. Click here to learn more…This blog will walk you through the high level steps to replicating this environment and making it your own.Step 1 - Create Local EnvironmentGitHubTo work locally on your content, you will need to install a GitHub client. Typically, the GitHub Desktop client is good for most day to day activities. If you are more adventurous you can use the command line client and do everything you need using that - you’ll probably need to install the command line client regardless if you want to deploy to MkDocs using the MkDocs commands.  GitHub desktop client: This can be used to manage commits and synchronize them from the local Git repository to the master repository in GitHub. The client can be downloaded here with more detailed information here. You may need to use your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate depending on which GitHub instance being used.  Git command line: To use command line, you must install a Git client, such as Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac, Linux). This set up will require you to configure SSH authentication. For Windows, download and install the Git Bash client. For Mac, download the Git client here. You’ll also need to run the git config commands to set up your user name and email.VS CodeVS Code is really useful as a markdown editor, especially if you are just learning. It also supports creating a local MkDocs environment, so you can preview changes before uploading. This isn’t the only option, but it is the one we typically use.In GitHub Desktop client, select Visual Studio Code as your editor - for GitHub Desktop client, select File…Options, click on the Advanced tab and update External Editor.PythonInstall Python. On installation, make sure the option to add this to your $PATH statement is selected. If you’re not sure what one to pick and you are using Windows - use this one.MkDocs + ExtensionsRun the following scripts using the command prompt to install MkDocs and the extensions used in template:  python -m pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed pip  pip --version  pip install mkdocs  pip install mkdocs-material  pip install markdown-include  pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin  pip install mkdocs-macros-pluginStep 2 - Grab the TemplateFork &amp; Clone to create a copy of this repository. For those that prefer not to use the Git command line, you can use the GitHub Desktop client for this - video.Step 3 - Makes it YoursThere are some basic changes you’ll need to make the mkdocs.yml file - you’ll find it in the root folder of your forked repository.The sections to change can be easily identified, as all are prefixed with [update as needed] in the commented notes.For example:# [update as needed] specify name for your site - this is included at top left of page next to logo site_name: MkDocs Sample# [update as needed] specify the URL to the GitHub repo for this site - included as link top rightrepo_url: https://github.dxc.com/AET/DocAsCodeSamples-mkdocs/Step 4 - Test the WatersTake a look around the MkDocs template site, get to know how the navigation works based on the folder structures defined in the repository. You’ll want to think about how you want to structure your content, in order to define the topic areas (top menu) and content (left menu). It’s a good idea to have a picture in your mind or even on paper :smile: so that you understand the folder structure you  need to create it.Step 5 - Add Your StuffWhen have an initial idea of how you want to structure your content visualized, start building that hierarchy in your local repository clone. The hierarchy you would be created should be defined in the docs folder.To make changes in VS Code, open the tool and click on the Explorer option (first button in left menu or shortcut ctrl-shift-E).Select File…Open Folder and select the root folder of the cloned repository - this opens the folder hierarchy in VS Code.Double-click on content to edit - most content uses markdown. Right-click on an item to see edit options.You can rename folders, create new folders and move stuff around. If you are really adventurous, you can even nest folders, to create a more advanced navigation outline for the left menu.Don’t forget, that only folders that contain at least one markdown file (*.md) will be displayed. So empty folders are ignored. You can create new pages or repurpose the ones that are there, but you’ll probably want to rename them :smile:.If you know you are going to have a lot of content - define some sort of naming convention for your files. It will make things easier for you in the long run.Step 6 - Serve it UpTo create a local published copy of your content, open a terminal session (Terminal…New Terminal) in VS Code, the repo folder on your system should be displayed as default path. Type mkdocs serve &amp; click [enter] to launch the site locally, and see your changes in published mode in a browser window. Once you have done this, any further changes you make to the content will automatically be rendered until you close that session.The local URL is displayed in the output from the mkdocs serve command i.e. [I 190626 11:06:05 server:298] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000NoteIf you are using Windows, the above command may not work out-of-the-box. A quick solution may be to preface every Python command with python -m like this:python -m pip install mkdocspython -m mkdocsFor a more permanent solution, you may need to edit your PATH environment variable to include the Scripts directory of your Python installation. Recent versions of Python include a script to do this for you. Navigate to your Python installation directory (for example C:\\Python34\\), open the Tools, then Scripts folder, and run the win_add2path.py file by double clicking on it. Alternatively, you can download the script and run it (python win_add2path.py).Step 7 - Publish and be Damned…To generate page content for upload to GitHub - open a new terminal session (Terminal…New Terminal) in VS Code and type mkdocs build &amp; click [enter]. This populates the site folder content, which represents the actual published content.To manually deploy content to GitHub pages - in the terminal session type mkdocs gh-deploy &amp; click [enter].To do this, if you haven’t already you must register your PAT for GitHub, see following for instructions to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), then open the Windows Credential Manager (bottom left in Windows, click on search icon and type credential to see launch option). Select Windows Credentials and scroll down the GitHub entries, update the GitHub entries with your PAT from GitHub.Step 8 - Final FrontierThe sample repo has been configured with an automated deployment pipeline using Platform DXC Jenkins.To enable this in your own environment, you must fork this repo to your own organization in GitHub. Jenkins integration must be enabled for this organization  - see onboarding instructions.You can reuse the jenkinsfile that is included with the template - you will need to modify the job to use add your own global credentials i.e. your PAT from GitHub. Note the credential must be given the ID mkdocs. The steps to be followed to add the credentials to Jenkins are a small bit complicated and are covered in more advanced topics - ask if you need help!Watch the Q&amp;A session video for this blog.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Why bother with documentation-as-code?",
        "excerpt":"A few reasons you might want to start thinking about documentation-as-code... A few reasons you might want to jump in…Diagrams-as-CodeDid you know you can create simple flow diagrams from text-based content?sequenceDiagramparticipant Lucyparticipant Commentparticipant Youparticipant ThinkingLucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: Mermaid diagrams are so coool...!Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy: Looks complex, Visio is easier.alt Too hard?Note over Lucy,Thinking: This gets easier once you start using it...endLucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: I couldn't get a licence for Visio...Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy:  My team purchased a license for me.alt Ouch...Note over Lucy,Thinking: Did you know you don't need a license for this?endLucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: Using Mermaid, I can track exactly what has changed over time.Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy: Me too - I create a new tab in Visio for each version.alt Manual Versioning - Yikes!Note over Lucy,Thinking: Text based content means you can track exactly what changes.endLucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: How do you include diagrams in your documents?Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy: We cut &amp; paste diagrams into our documents.Lucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: Did you know you could leverage content using this solution?Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy: What does that mean?alt Sounds Complicated...Note over Lucy,Thinking: Some frameworks let you cross-reference shared content, i.e., re-use without replicating.endLucy-&gt;&gt;Thinking: Store once, cross reference, update once and changes cascade.Thinking-&gt;&gt;Lucy: WOW!alt Try it!Note over Lucy,Thinking: Imagine - you keep your content consistent and updated...endThe diagram is rendered entirely from simple text-based syntax (apologies to the purist for potential misuse of sequence diagram). It is one example of what you can create if you want to.This example is also leveraged - the only text included here is a reference to the file where the content resides (view source). Imagine, where you have common diagrams that you want to include in multiple places - with this you only store one version of the content, but it may appear in many different places. If you need to change - you change and updates cascade through automatically.Click here for more examples of diagrams as code.Documents-as-CodeYou get all the same benefits with documents as you do with diagrams - better versioning, support for leveraged content and graphics and so much more. Improved navigation, full search capability, automation…Admittedly, there is a learning curve, it takes some time to get used to something different, but that doesn’t mean that because it is different it is bad.Inner Source / Open Source  Open source is a term denoting that a product includes permission to use its source code, design documents, or content. wikipedia  Inner source is the use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open source-like culture within organizations. The organization may still develop proprietary software, but internally opens up its development.  wikipediaDocumentation-as-code supports the extension of inner source / open source practices beyond source code - to the documentation that supports these solutions or any other documentation, there are no boundaries or limits. It allows an organization to better benefit and utilize organizational knowledge, by making content more easily available and accessible to all. Enabling individuals to contribute to other team’s content, to leverage that content and to learn from that content - why keep re-inventing the wheel…Most if not all open source projects use documentation-as-code for all support collateral - this should be the norm for inner source too!Lose the page…If you think about documents, almost all documents are focused on the concept of the printed page, but how many documents actually get printed? Why do we spend so much time and effort building our content around a standard sized sheet of paper, when most of us prefer to consume the content on a screen that is potentially much smaller!The samples we show are all responsive, in that the display adjusts as your screen size changes. You can still print or save as PDF, if you want an offline copy, but with these examples, the focus is the online experience.Bigger is not always betterThese samples also focus on how to make large documents more easy to consume. Nobody wants to read a 100+ page document and it is very frustrating when the content you are looking for is on page 98…These samples show options to break down large documents into smaller sections, without losing their context or the ability to move across sections. They also have the advantage that you no longer have to reference sections headings, page numbers, sub-bullets, etc., to help people find specific content, with an online experience, you can link directly to anywhere in the document seamlessly…Search capability also provides the ability for the user to run ad hoc searches across content in all documents and find what they are looking for.Quality &amp; AutomationAs you move more towards the type of solution shown in the samples, you open opportunities to automate. This could just be the automation of the publication process, but why not go further. With a pipeline, you now have the option to include quality checks in the publication process.You can be assured that your content is spell-checked, you can ensure that links are validated, not only on publication, but an ongoing basis. No more undiscovered broken links. Format checks can be incorporated - the scope for quality check is vast.My experience with working with traditional documents, is that they are poorly formatted, often there are typos and very often hyperlinks are broken - with these solutions there is no excuse and no reason for this.Presentations-as-CodeThis is really cool - presentations built from text-based content. Graphics and content can be leveraged to support ease of maintenance and ensure consistency.  Decks are easily shared, can be printed or saved as PDF for offline reference. There are options for speaker notes, which are versioned, so you can use these to support a review process as well as to define intent of your deck. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. The slides you see here are generated from text. It is branded following DXC guidelines. It includes images and text. The slide transition into view as you expect with a presentation.What you also get is that some content can be leveraged, so potentially common to multiple decks. You can click anywhere in the presentation and type s to view speaker notes. And there is moreClick here for more examples and information.SummaryDocumentation-as-code is the concept of treating document content in the same way you would source code, but it is so much more.With this approach, you can now share content, you potentially have full search capability, inherent navigation, better audit control, automation - the list goes on.Plus, one more thing, you will be inner sourcing your content - so now others can contribute to what you create, you have opportunities to participate in the creation of other team’s content and content can more easily be found and re-used.When I am asked why bother with documentation as code, my answer is WHY NOT?If you want to learn more about documentation-as-code and how to get started - click here…Watch the video for this blog.Watch the Q&amp;A session video for this blog.Why Bother - more reasons…For even more reasons check out the Why Bother… presentation - anywhere in the presentation view and type s to view speaker’s notes.

        "title": "Contributing in GitHub...",
        "excerpt":"Learn how you contribute to content it GitHub - from beginner to advanced... GitHub is the inner source / open source center of DXC. It provides the ability for teams to securely store and protect their content, while at the same time allowing any user to draft and propose changes to content or potentially leverage content to address their own needs.All teams are strongly encouraged to use GitHub to host, manage and maintain their content in GitHub to encourage broader collaboration and reuse of content within specific teams and also with users outside a specific organization.In this blog we will discuss 4 different paths you can take to contribute to content in GitHub - starting with beginner users and ending with more advanced concepts.You’ll find lots of typos, if you want to put the theory into practice and actually contribute the fixes… get you feet wet!   Beginners - getting startedThe easiest way for novice GitHub users to contribute to content within GitHub is to submit an issue. Issues are the mechanism in Github you would use to track feedback, report problems, i.e. define a backlog. Any user can submit an issue to a public repository, for private repositories, only users with access to that repository can submit an issue.If you are reveiwing content source directly in a GitHub repository, you can create a new issue by clicking on the Issues tab and then clicking on New issue button on the right. This opens the new issue page, where you can enter a description of your feedback, i.e., what you would change, report a defect, etc. Markdown is supported, so you can format your text to make it more easily understood if desired. You would clicked the Submit new issue button when you were ready to submit.For GitHub pages, it is recommended that a link be included on each page, that allows users to directly submit an issue on the content. For example, the first iocn at bottom-left corner of the MkDocs Content Library template and bottom of left menu in the Minimal Mistakes Web template. This functionality is built into these templates, so assuming the pages are configured per the instructions, these links should work.For teams that want to provide additional guidance to users when they are submitting an issue, issue templates can be created within their GitHub repo, that provide guidance on the sort of information that a user should include when submmitting feedback. Multiple templates can be created if they want to provide different guidance based on the type of issue/feedback being reported. Watch quick video.Easy - making changes in GitHubIf you want to contribute directly to content in GitHub, the easiest way to do this is to make your changes through the GitHub web interface - no need to download or install anything locally.While the overall approach is similar, whether you are working on your own content, or contributing to another team’s content, they are however slightly different. The main variance is whether you create a branch or a fork to manage your updates. Both a branch and a fork are essentially an isolated copy of the content, where you can safely change any content without impacting the master version. So if you think about the master copy being the published version, you typically do not want to make on the fly changes to that - you want to update in draft mode and then control when or even if you ultimately want to publish. A brnch or fork allows you to do that - it isolates the changes to that specific location until you are ready to pull the trigger and publish.If contributing to another team’s content, depending on how you proceed, GitHub can seamlessly create the fork and a branch for you - so all you need to focus on is what you want to change.Option 1 - not so easyOne option, although not necessarily the easiest option, assuming there is one, is to click on the page edit button on the page you want to edit.  In the MkDocs template, click on the Go to GitHub link at the top right to view the GitHub repository associated with this content.  In the Minimal Mistakes template, scroll down to the footer and click on the GitHub@DXC link to view the GitHub repository associated with this content.Once in the GitHub repository, navigate to the file you want to update, click on that file to view the contents and then click the Edit this file icon, i.e., the pencil at the top right of the content window, to open the file in edit mode. This triggers GitHub to automatically create the fork for and a branch and opens the file in edit mode within that branch, so you can then make changes.Option 2 - much easierAlternatively, if you don’t want to prowl the GitHub repository, there could be an easier option. In many GitHub pages sites, the authors have included edit links on every page, so all you need to do is navigate to that page and click the link.  In the MkDocs template, click on the Edit this page icon to the right of the page title.  In the Minimal Mistakes template, scroll down to the footer and click on the Edit this page link.This triggers GitHub to automatically create the fork for and a branch and opens the file in edit mode within that branch, so you can then proceed to update.When you’ve completed your changes, click Propose changes at the bottom the screen to commit these changes, i.e., save them. Next, you will be asked if you want to create a Pull Request for these changes - this is the process used to communicate to the owner of the content that you have some proposed changes. This gives the owner the opportunity to review these changes, potentially have a discussion through the pull request to clarify if needed and then either approve them and merge back the master for publication or reject themt.After this you have the option to delete your fork or leave it in case you want to make more changes in the future. If you leave it, you do need to be aware that any changes made by other people to the published content will not be automatically reflected in your repository - you’ll see messages in your repository if the master has commits that have not been synchronized to your fork. To synchronize - you can create a pull request to pull the latest content from the master to your fork. The trick here is to make sure that the fork copy is identified as the target - listed on the left hand and the master is identified as the source - listed on the right. If this is too dauntineg to think about to start with - just delete the forks once you have finished your changes.If working on your own content, i.e., in a repository where you have write access, you need to create the branch manually, unless you protected, i.e., locked down, the master copy so you cannot edit directly - and that’s not a bad idea to do that, it enforces good habits… Once you have your branch, you cann use either of the options above to open the file you want to change in edit mode - without the fork. You manually create the pull request once you have completed your edits, following a similar process. You do an extra option for pull request once processed - you can optionallyi delete the branch automatically when you close the pull request. This is recommendede, so that branches do not get stale or become orphaned.Intermediate - working offline using GitHub Desktop ClientIf you have a lot of changes to make to content, you probably want to download the content to your PC, i.e., clone the repository using the GitHub Desktop client, and then make your edits locallyy. This can be done using the command line interface (CLI), but for non-technical users, the GitHub Desktop client is easier.Note: If working on a repository for which you have read/write access, you can clone the repository directly. If you do not have this direct access, you must first fork the content in GitHub and then create the clone.When cloning your repo, you are prompted to download the desktop client, if you do not have it installed already. Once installed, you can repeat the cloning instructions and when prompted identify the local path you want to create the repository in. The actual cloning process shouldn’t take too long, but this will depend on the size of the repository.Once completed, the first thing to do is to create a new branch to manage your changes - select Branch…New branch from the main menu, specify a name for the new branch and then clicke on the Create branch button. It is always a best practice to make updates in a branch rather than in the master. This isolates sets of changes and gives an easy option to discard changes if required.Next, you can select how you want to access the content - you should see options displayed in the desktop client, e.g., Open in Explorer - opens in Windows Explorer, or if you have a markdown editor installed and configured to integrate with the desktope client, you may see an option to open with that editor, e.g., Open in Visual Studio Code.The instructions for accessing, updating and saving content varies based on the editor you are using.Once you have completed all the changes you wish to make - you would return to the GitHub Desktop client and commit these changes. You should the lists of changed files listed in the left panef - so you can verify the changes are complete and as expected. Sometimes you’ll see a rogue file, like a temp file listed.To commit, enter a brief title and comment for this commit at bottom left, then click on the Commit button - bottom left. This commits the changes to the local copy of your repository only - you wille still need to push them back to the ‘mothership’, i.e., the repository stored in GitHub. To do this, click on the Push buttoon or select Repository…Push from the main menu. This synchronizes your local changes to the central GitHub server.Next, to synchronize your changes to master repo, you’ll need to create a Pull Request - this is process used to communicate to the owner of the content that you some proposed change. This gives the owner the opportunity to review these changes, potentially have a discussion through the pull request to clarify if needed and then either approve them and merge back the master for publication or reject them.Once the pull request is processed and closed, it is recommended that you delete your branch - if it was not deleted as part of the pull request processing.Advanced - working offline using Git Command Line InterfaceThe most complex process to manage your changes, but if you master this, you are truly a GitHub Jedi warrior… :smiles:confirm your user infoensure Git user.name and user.email are setThe user.email in particular should be your DXC E-mail address since this is how GitHub identifies your contributions as yours. If not set, commits still work, but they will not be linked to your profile info.$ git config --global user.name \"FirstName LastName\"$ git config --global user.email \"FirstName.LastName@dxc.com\"$ git config user.name(confirm it shows your first name followed by last name)$ git config user.email(confirm it shows your @dxc.com e-mail address)set user.dxc-github-usernameThis is not used internally by Git, but is useful when following the process below. If it’s not set, you’ll need to substitute it into the appropriate places yourself.$ git config --global user.dxc-github-username &lt;your DXC GitHub username, probably your Global Pass short ID&gt;$ git config user.dxc-github-username(your DXC GitHub user name should be displayed)This custom Git variable is used during various commands in the below process and each person’s username will vary.decide on a connection method: SSH or HTTPSHTTPS considerationsCloning using SSH works well from the Git Bash CLI. However, depending on your network, you may not be able to get to github.dxc.com on SSH port 22. In that case, cloning via HTTPS may be a better choice. HTTPS requires a GitHub API Key instead of an ssh key, and the API key is used in place of a GitHub user password when performing updates via git commands.To create an API key, follow the generic GitHub “Creating a personal access token for the command line” process. For the purposes of most day-to-day operations “repo” access for the key is sufficient. In general, it’s safer to create a token with insufficient privileges and work through the resulting “permission denied” errors than to grant too much access and have a bug or misunderstanding lead to a massive, automated mess that must be cleaned up by hand. :bomb:It’s possible to cache the API key using a Git credential helper (similar to ssh-agent). The most compatible helper with Git for Windows is wincred, which can be enabled via:$ git config --global credential.helper wincredThis is a built-in Windows function. You can get details about it from Microsoft SecAuthN docs on Credential Managerthe rest of this process uses SSHThese instructions assume SSH since it works well with Git Bash, works on non-Windows platforms, and only requires you to enter your pass phrase once.set up ssh key authentication in GitHubcreate an ssh public/private key pair$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -C $(git config user.email)The $(command) syntax in bash runs command and adds that output in the appropriate spot in the command line.Be sure your pass phrase is strong, this is the only thing between that key and the potential for data destruction or misrepresentation on GitHub. A long pass phrase is highly recommended and also easier to remember than some convoluted yet short mix of characters.For more details see Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent. You do not need to add your key to the agent yet– we’ll get to that here shortly.tell GitHub about your new public keyOnce you have your key pair created, tell GitHub about your PUBLIC key. For any key pair, SSH or otherwise, you should NEVER EVER SEND YOUR PRIVATE KEY TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON. At best, the person asking for it is confused because it will NEVER BE NEEDED BY ANYONE BUT YOU. At worst, they could be an imposter trying to steal your access. This goes not only for SSH keys but any sort of public key method (SSL, GPG, etc.)Copy your SSH PUBLIC key to the clipboard:$ clip &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pubFollow the rest of the steps in Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account since there’s nothing DXC-specific there.add your ssh key to your local ssh agentThis way you don’t need to keep typing in that super long and very secure pass phrase.$ ssh-agent -s &gt; ~/ssh-agent.vars$ source ~/ssh-agent.vars$ set | grep SSH_SSH_AGENT_PID=20332SSH_ASKPASS=/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-gui--askpassSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-hZPpXK32ssKi/agent.19882$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;enter your pass phrase for the last time this session&gt;If you open another Bash session you can re-use the same ssh-agent you already started by doing the following in the new window:$ source ~/ssh-agent.vars$ set | grep SSH_SSH_AGENT_PID=20332SSH_ASKPASS=/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-gui--askpassSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-hZPpXK32ssKi/agent.19882The values should be the same as before. In fact, if you look at the ssh-agent.vars file you’ll see something like this:SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-hZPpXK32ssKi/agent.19882; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;SSH_AGENT_PID=20332; export SSH_AGENT_PIDecho Agent pid 20332The Bash source command means to pull the environment variables from an external file into the current bash script session. By putting those “secret” values into a file and using “source” you can pass them around between sessions easily.start your editor from bash with SSH_AUTH_SOCK set (optional)If you use something like Visual Studio Code, which has built-in support for Git, in order for git to work correctly with SSH keys it needs to have SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID set correctly. The simplest way to do this is to simply start that editor from bash once those environment variables are set. For example:$ source ~/ssh-agent.vars$ set | grep SSH_SSH_AGENT_PID=20332SSH_ASKPASS=/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-gui--askpassSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-hZPpXK32ssKi/agent.19882$ code(The “code” command starts Visual Studio Code with the environment set up so you can use git pull and git push using your secure, passphrase-protected SSH key without having to type the passphrase in except for that first time during ssh-add.)For more details about this issue and Visual Studio Code, check vscode issue #13680.fork the repo in GitHubThis cannot be done with the Git command line because Git has no concept of a fork. Forks are a GitHub concept where it duplicates the Git repository so that the Git tools can pull this new-to-Git data directly.Some general info about forking a repo can be found on the GitHub site.rename the repo in GitHub (optional)While technically optional, once one has a collection of many forks mixed with personal repositories, it can get a bit messy. One method to help keep things organized is to preface each fork with the name of the original owning GitHub user or organization. For example, the AET/TIPS-ToolFinder repository could be renamed to AET-TIPS-ToolFinder. One possible reason to avoid renaming is there could be internal links reliant on the original name– but minimizing those is a good practice and they can always be fixed within one’s individual forks.clone the repoIt may be helpful to put all the github.dxc.com content in one directory, especially once one starts using github.com for world-wide use, it can get a bit confusing to remember which repos were from where.$ mkdir github.dxc.com$ cd github.dxc.com$ git clone git@github.dxc.com:$(git config user.dxc-github-username)/AET-TIPS-ToolFinder.gitCloning into 'AET-TIPS-ToolFinder'...remote: Enumerating objects: 18832, done....$ cd AET-TIPS-ToolFinderThe Bash syntax $(command) means to run command and insert its output at that point in the command line. In this case since we set that custom Git variable earlier it will substitute your GitHub username in the right spot.make a feature branchThis is part of the GitHub flow method of making changes. While you can make changes directly to master this is highly discouraged, even for beginners. The main reason is that a pull request refers to a branch so if you open a pull request based on your own fork’s master branch, then add commits AFTER the pull request, those commits show up as part of THAT SAME PULL REQUEST. This can be very confusing.By creating a branch, only commits made to that same branch will appear in the pull request. By opening a new branch after your pull request for future/additional/tentative changes you can ensure that those commits don’t appear in the prior pull request and cause confusion about what exactly is being proposed.To make a branch, think of a descriptive name and then create it using git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;. Avoid using the probably-not-what-you-want-but-it-sounds-promising git branch command.$ git checkout -b &lt;NEW_BRANCH_NAME&gt;$ git statusOn branch &lt;NEW_BRANCH_NAME&gt;make your changes and stage the filesUse the editor of your choice to make the changes you want. Then stage the files that are changing. While it may be tedious to do this one at a time, using git add or the editor’s Git integration feature to add files individually is highly encouraged.When using “add all the files” shortcuts, beginners often check in things they didn’t intend to. Save the shortcuts for later and get some practice with a longer, but safer method at the start and just add the files you know you want.add unwanted files to .gitignore (optional)If you see files appear that you know you never want to add to Git, add a useful matching pattern to your .gitignore file. This file is tricky to create on Windows, but there are several ways to create it.commit the changesThe commit is the smallest unit at which Git operates. Making more, smaller commits is better than fewer, larger commits. Each time a change is made that seems to be part of one logical whole, make a commit.If you know it’s not complete, using a marker like WIP for Work In Progress can help others understand that it wasn’t intended to be fully working yet.A git commit statement should have its first line as a relatively short description of the purpose of the commit.Then insert an empty line.After that, put in a detailed description of the commit. For example this might make a good commit message:Create CLI based git fork processThis change describes a method to use Git commands for making changes to a forked repository. It's intended as a starting point and known gaps vs. a good future state are marked with TODO.edit more and commit more as neededpush your changesThe branch you created earlier only exists on your local host. GitHub has no knowledge of it. In fact, when you run a git push it will NOT PUSH YOUR NEW BRANCH. First, the remote Git repo needs to know about this new branch:$ git push --set-upstream origin &lt;NEW_BRANCH_NAME&gt;--set-upstream is equivalent to -u but more descriptive. This tells Git to push your local branch to the remote server, which a simple git push will not do by default.Tab completion works for branch names.If you’ve forgotten the branch name, git status will tell you:$ git statusOn branch &lt;NEW_BRANCH_NAME&gt;Visual Studio Code pushes new branches by defaultIf you use the “publish changes” feature of Visual Studio Code on a newly created branch, it will upload the branch to GitHub by default.open a pull requestThe concept of a “pull request” is not built into Git, but (like fork) is another GitHub concept. There is no Git CLI command for this, and it must be done using the GitHub web interface.TODO: Link to a good description of making a DXC GitHub pull request, or if it doesn’t exist yet– make it.The name “pull request” is a bit odd, but it helps to think about it not from your perspective, but the perspective of the owner of the upstream GitHub repository. Someone is making a request to “pull” their code/changes into the main repository.It can also be thought of as starting a conversation about a specific set of changes proposed. Changes and modifications are expected and normal, but a pull request lets people discuss something very specific when compared to something less specific like an Issue. In general, if there’s a way to turn a question, concern, or improvement into a specific pull request, do so. If not, then opening an Issue is better than letting the problem remain unknown.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Minimal Mistakes - Web Pages - Getting Started...",
        "excerpt":"Create your own web site with GitHub pages and Minimal Mistakes powered by Jekyll - follow this quick start guide to learn more... Learn how to mix your own flavour of web site using our Our Site Minimal Mistakes template. This is a popular template and is widely used within DXC. It is intended for teams that want to create a web presence or site and is not best suited if you are more interested in creating a content or document library - the MkDocs template is better suited for that purpose.Note: The follow instructions do not go into detail about best practices for managing commits in GitHub. It is always recommended that updates are made within a branch within your repository off the master branch or from a fork of that repository. Then the synchronization (merge) of these updates back to the master branch are managed and tracked using a pull request. Refer here for an overview of this workflow.Step 1 - Create Local EnvironmentGitHubTo work locally on your content, you will need to install a GitHub client. Typically, the GitHub Desktop client is good for most day to day activities. If you are more adventurous you can use the command line client and do everything you need using that.  GitHub desktop client: This can be used to manage commits and synchronize them from the local Git repository to the master repository in GitHub. The client can be downloaded here with more detailed information here. You may need to use your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate depending on which GitHub instance being used.  Git command line: To use command line, you must install a Git client, such as Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac, Linux). This set up will require you to configure SSH authentication. For Windows, download and install the Git Bash client. For Mac, download the Git client here. You’ll also need to run the git config commands to set up your user name and email.VS CodeVS Code is really useful as a markdown editor, especially if you are just learning.In GitHub Desktop client, select Visual Studio Code as your editor - for GitHub Desktop client, select File…Options, click on the Advanced tab and update External Editor. You don’t need this, but you may find it useful when working offline because it provides the ability to preview markdown, so you validate how your content looks. You can also download extensions for markdown linting (format checks) and spell checks - to hep guide you as you build content.JekyllIf you want to be able to generate a locally hosted version of your pages prior to committing any changes to GitHub, you’ll need to install a Jekyll environment. There are obvious benefits to doing this, but it is not required - we have avoided this step by reviewing content in a forked environment within GitHub.To create a local environment, follow the instructions documented here.Step 2 - Grab the TemplateFork &amp; Clone to create a copy of this repository. For those that prefer not to use the Git command line, you can use the GitHub Desktop client for this - video.Step 3 - Makes it YoursThere are some basic changes you’ll need to make the config.yml file - you’ll find it in the root folder of your forked repository.The specific instructions for this are included in the template here. You’ll find the corresponding files in your forked copy within the _tailor folder.Step 4 - Test the WatersTake a look around the OurSite template site, get to know how the navigation works based on the different menus - top menu and left menu. These are manually defined within the navigation.yml folder within the _data folder.You’ll want to think about what menu options you want to include - in the example, which is similar to the outline we use in the Global SME sites, the top menu links back to other sites and assets we manage, the left menu links to different pages within this site. This is how we defined the navigation, but it is up to you what decide to do. There instructions to update top menu and ]left menu when you’ve decided ow you want to define this.Step 5 - Add Your StuffWhen you have an initial idea of how you want to structure and navigate your content, you can start thinking about the content.The site essentially consists of a home page, standalone pages and collections - to be explained below.Home pageThe home is generated from the file index.html. It is the only file in the  repo that must have an html extension. You can include html files if you want or need to, but you can also define all other content using markdown files *.md. The home page includes a sliding banner and then a series of what are referred to as feature rows. Each feature row consists of a set of 1 to 3 asset references. These provide a mechanism to showcase specific things about your team of your site content. Each asset reference has a image associated with it, a title, a brief description and a link to get more information. You can define as many feature rows as you need to. The instructions for updating the home page are here.Standalone pagesThese are basic pages, where you define whatever content you need. Each page must have specific yml parameters include at the top of the page - the easiest way to ensure you include all the appropriate attributes - is to copy from another page and then edit the content. Page content is typically defined using markdown syntax, although html can be included if more advanced formatting is required. Instructions for creating a standalone page are available here.CollectionsA collection is a special type of page in Minimal Mistakes - when it is created, you create both a page and a corresponding folder. You can include in the page, but it will also pull in as linked references, the markdown files from the folder created. The content you see when you click on the Replicate this site link in the template is an example of a collection. This is useful if you want to create more dynamic sets of related information, e.g., the instructions for the different tasks you need to undertake to recreate this site.You can repurpose the existing collections in the template, e.g., change page names, add content or you create own new collections. The instructions for creating a new collection are here and for adding a new sub-page to that collection here.There is one out of the box collection that is configured within Jekyll - posts. This has additional functionality that is not available for other collections.PermalinksOne thing when you are defining the permalink attribute data within the yml parameters for the pages and collections - what define here should be used when hyperlinking to that page, i.e., as a placeholder for the actual page URL, it also defines the breadcrumb trail you see at the top of this page. Therefore some planning is needed when created a more complex site, firstly to make the values intuitive, so users can easily create hyperlinks to that page if needed, but also so that the breadcrumb trail makes sense when browsing the content. For novice users, this may take time to grasp the concept, but is very powerful once you understand it.VS CodeIf you are using VS Code - here are some basic instructions to get you started, open the tool and click on the Explorer option (first button in left menu or shortcut ctrl-shift-E).Select File…Open Folder and select the root folder of the cloned repository - this opens the folder hierarchy in VS Code.Double-click on content to edit - most content uses markdown. Right-click on an item to see edit options.You can rename folders, create new folders and move stuff around. If you are really adventurous, you can even nest folders, to create a more advanced navigation outline for the left menu.Don’t forget, that only folders that contain at least one markdown file (*.md) will be displayed. So empty folders are ignored. You can create new pages or repurpose the ones that are there, but you’ll probably want to rename them :smile:.If you know you are going to have a lot of content - define some sort of naming convention for your files. It will make things easier for you in the long run.Step 6 - Publish and be Damned…If you have a local environment installed, you can optionally preview published content. If you want to preview without installing a local environment - you can create another fork from your forked copy of the repo, enable GitHub pages in this new forked copy, preview and then disable. The only thing you need to consider is that the config.yml will not be updated for this new fork, so links will default back to the original fork.To publish in GitHub, you will need to enable GitHUb pages in your forked repo - this creates a new GitHub site specific to that repo. The instructions for enabling this are included in the Getting Started step. Once you have the URL for your site, don’t forget to update the information within the repository description.Step 7 - Final FrontierThe sample repo has been configured with an automated deployment pipeline using Platform DXC Jenkins.To enable this in your own environment, you must fork this repo to your own organization in GitHub. Jenkins integration must be enabled for this organization  - see onboarding instructions.You can reuse the jenkinsfile that is included with the template - you will need to modify the job to use add your own global credentials. At this point, the instructions get complicated and are covered in more advanced topics - ask if you need help!Watch the Q&amp;A session video for this blog.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Converting to Markdown...",
        "excerpt":"Learn how to convert Word into Markdown via Writage... Writage – A Tool to Begin the Markdown AgeOne of the first questions asked when one ventures in the world of documentation-as-code is:  “What do I do with all of my Word Documents?”Well first you need to decide if you really need to convert them or if they are fine in their original form and location.Evaluate if Conversion NeededWill the current location be decommissioned?If the current location for your documents is going away, then they need to go somewhere. That can be a good motivation to shift them into a Documentation as Code environment. Go ahead and convert your documents.Is the document actively updated?If the document rarely changes, then waiting to convert until a change is needed is a good way to avoid wasted effort and keep your work flow efficient. If the document is updated frequently, then the benefits of a Documentation as Code environment can make it worth the effort. Go ahead and convert your document.No conversion needed: link to the original locationIf a document doesn’t need converting, then a link to its original location in any new documentation is sufficient.Conversion needed: Proceed with ConversionIf the answer is “Yes”, then you need a means to convert them.  One such tool to help you in the conversion is “Writage”.  Writage is currently a free to download Markdown plugin for Microsoft Word.  It can be downloaded from Writage Website.  While the site claims to “turns Word into your Markdown WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) editor”, it is not quite that easy. Documents are often messy and not formatted ideally or consistently and sometimes contains down right creative formatting.  The result is not always perfect.  However, the Writage tool can get you most of the way there and limit the amount of manual Markdown corrections you have to do.  This blog will walk you through the install and your first document conversion to Markdown.  So let’s get started.The InstallAs shared above download the addin from Writage Website and double click the install and follow the instructions. Upon completion, Writage is ready to use in Word.Using the Writage AddinThe first thing you will notice when you open up Microsoft Word is the new Writage tab on the menu bar:Clicking on the tab reveals two functions: 1) Copy Markdown and 2) Paste Markdown.These two functions support when you want to:  Copy Word Text into an application or browser that supports markdown.And…  Paste text into Word that you copied from someplace else that is already in markdown format in order to edit the text in Word.Both functions assume that you want to use Word as your editor for markdown formatted text.The addin installation added one more function to Microsoft Word: Save As Markdown.This is where you will “convert” your documents to Markdown.  Simply click “save as markdown” and click save.  The addin will do the rest.  But as you will see in the next section, the conversion is not exact.Writage Conversion ExampleI don’t have many Microsoft Word documents anymore so I am using a user guide document for an example: R for GAMS.  I will attach the document to the blog for you to experiment if you wish. The document is 22 pages long with table of contents, font changes, images, links, page numbers, and a simple table.  The original file size is: 2717 kb.  The converted markdown file 26 kb.  So what happened? Well not everything in Microsoft Word is supported in markdown.  Here is a short list of what happened in this document conversion:  The centering was removed and the title page is flush left.  The Microsoft Word generated Table of Contents was removed.  Headers, footers, and page numbers were removed.  The Microsoft style Headings 1, 2, and 3 were converted to respective markdown headers. However, the conversion uses a non-standard method of notation. See below for heading 1 example. verses   Images were copied to a new folder called “media” and unique hex names were associated to them.  The relative references to the images were added to the converted markdown file.  Links were preserved.  Simple formatting (bold, italics, lists, indented text, etc.) was preserved. Complex formatting, like text wrapping around graphics, were removed.  Font changes and colors were removed.  Single and double spacing after headings were preserved.  Simple table was preserved, however, the formatting was removed.Writage Conversion SummaryPros  Quick conversion of existing Microsoft Word documents  Most of the markdown supported formatting is preservedCons  Word/Writage is not your go-to markdown editor  Word converted files will need to be reviewed and edited in a markdown editor for final touch-ups  Images are assigned complex hexadecimal names and may need to be renamed and referenced in the document to increase ease of future maintenance.Markdown Additional ResourcesFinally, here are a list of additional resources for converting and creating markdown files:  Writage Website  Github Markdown Cheatsheet  Atom Markdown EditorWatch the Q&amp;A session video for this blog.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"Learn how to fix up diagrams in converted markdown... Image handling for converted Markdown documentsIf you followed the previous blog entry on converting Microsoft Word documents to Markdown format,most of the work associated with reformatting your text is already done. However, documents with images in them may requirean additional pass or two to clean up the included pictures and diagrams.What Writage does for youMost embedded pictures and diagrams are extracted from the source document and placed in the media folder located withyour output Markdown file. The generated filenames are long hashes derived from the image itself; this is good for deduplication(when the same image, such as a logo, appears in multiple documents) but is terrible for humans who would like to knowsomething about the image without actually opening it. The format of the image is not changed at all.What Writage does not do for youThe format of the image is not changed at all. If you have screenshots or similar bitmap data, they most likely are in .jpg or .pngformat. These are rendered natively by modern web browsers and do not represent a problem. You might have more exotic image formats,such as .tiff, which won’t be displayed.More commonly, vector diagrams (commonly pasted from PowerPoint or Visio, among others) are stored as .emf (Enhanced MetaFile) images,and also aren’t directly viewable.In real life, I also have encountered instances where Writage did not transfer the image at all – no image file is created in themedia folder, and no ![](media/filehash.ext) hyperlink is inserted in the Markdown document! This appears to be most common withcomplicated figures (such as busy full-page Visio diagrams); whether it’s a bug or an intentional sanity-check in Writage isunclear.The good news is that nearly all of these issues can be corrected with relatively little manual effort, resulting in graphicsthat can be displayed natively and look as good (or even better) than they did in the original Word document! The key is toconvert problematic images to .svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) format, which is natively rendered by browsers just like .jpgand .png images.What about Mermaid?You might have heard about Mermaid, which allows you to create “diagrams as code” and incorporate them directly in yourMarkdown documents. It is available for use with mkdocs-based sites, and you might consider it for simple, new figures.However, if you’re reading this blog, it’s probably because you have existing documents with existing figures that you’rehoping to preserve.As an experiment, I tried replacing a simple flowchart with a Mermaid-based equivalent. What I learned was that mechanicalconversion of the original figure was significantly faster, and that the Mermaid diagram was not nearly as visually appealingas the original.I’m sure that I could have spent even more time to dress up the Mermaid graphic, but why bother? Theconverted graphic is fully editable in Inkscape. Moreover, many of the images I have to deal with are extremely complex, andsomebody more talented than I already invested hours preparing it.My advice: quit while you’re ahead, and simply convert the images you already have.Getting Set UpThere probably are many capable image editing and conversion programs that could be used for this task, but I recommend Inkscape.It’s freely available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, is capable of doing everything we need, and the workflow you’ll use 99% ofthe time is pretty simple. You can download it from https://inkscape.org/ and install it on your system of choice. Ideally, thatwill be a Windows system so you can work side-by-side with the original source documents when required.Fixing the images in your converted Markdown documentMy general workflow consists of three stages:      Rename the generated image files        Convert non-native images        Identify and create dropped images  Let’s take each of these one at a time.Rename generated imagesLooking at generated hashes is terrible. You have no sense of whether or not the image is used, what it might be used by, oranything else about it. I prefer to rename all of the images referenced by a single document sequentially. This isn’t perfect,but it can be quickly using a script.Here’s what I use (on Linux) – I’m not sure if the git-bash environment on Windows would work or not:#!/bin/sh# mkdocs-fixmedia - change references to image files# Writage generates markdown files with inline images saved as basically# randomly-named files.

Thisis especially useful if you’ve converted multiple documents to the same place, as you’ll have a media folder will all imagescommingled and you can’t tell what belongs with what.Later on, you can rename these again to have more meaningful names as the mood strikes you. When you have documents with over 200images in them, life’s too short!One thing you may see is that, if the same image is used by multiple files, the first run will rename the image to associate itwith one file, and subsequent runs will fail to find the original file (and generate “Bogus reference” warnings). You’ll also seewarnings about bad references from mkdocs build.In practice, for my documents, the one persistent reuse was a DXC logo image. Note there’s a special test for our particular logofile (yours might have a different hash) to just rename it directly to dxc-logo.png, which can continue to be shared by multipledocuments.You’ll want to verify you don’t have any broken links at the end, possibly making copies of images or renaming them to addressany remaining shared images.Convert non-native imagesTake a look in your media/ folder and see what’s there. Files with .png and .jpg are okay and you can ignore them. Other filesneed to be converted. In my experience, these usually will be .emf but you can use the same process for all of them.Basically, that process is “use Inkscape to convert them to SVG” but there are a few nuances. Here’s the full process:      Open the original file in Inkscape (I haven’t found anything it won’t open)        Use Select-All (Control+A) to select the entire image content, and then Resize Page to Selection (Shift+Control+R)to reset the bounding box for the image. (This is necessary because I see that it’s subtly screwed up nearly all the time;I don’t know if it’s Microsoft’s fault or an Inkscape bug or a team effort.)        Use Save-As (Control+Shift+S) to save the document. The default type is “Inkscape SVG” (which is what you want), andthe default name is the same as the original (but with a “.svg” extension).(Exception: If you are working with a raster bitmap image, perhaps in a .tiff file, it would be better to save it asa “.png” image instead.)        Find the original reference(s) in your Markdown document, and change the extension from “.emf” (or whatever) to “.svg”(or whatever you saved it as).        Make sure the modified Markdown document and the new image file are added to your git commit set.        (Optionally) Delete the original image file (and add the deletion to your git commit). You might hold off on this untilyou’ve seen the image renders as expected in your document, in case additional tweaking is required.  Almost always, this is all you need to do. I have observed some especially “artsy” diagrams that used drop shadows and shadingwhich turned into a mess – the most common artifact is black rectangles that should have been hidden but get popped up to thetop, making it look like you have a redacted document. With care you can select and delete them, but you almost always end upselecting something else, so this can turn into an artistic game. Just remember you can Undo (Control+Z) any mistakes.Identify and create dropped imagesThis is a good time to look at your original document side-by-side with your new document (courtesy of mkdocs serve).As you scroll through both documents, ask yourself:      Does that image look like it did?        Is an image missing?  Sometimes Writage just didn’t extract an image at all, and rarely the extraction seems a bit half-baked. In both cases, copyingand pasting the image from Word directly into Inkscape will address the problem:      Select the image in Word. (Usually you can click on it, verify the bounding box handles have appeared on the edges of the image,and then use Control+C to copy it.) Complex images (large embedded Visio diagrams, for example) can take a surprisingly longtime to copy – these typically are the ones most likely to have been dropped by Writage.        Open a new (blank) Inkscape file, and use Control+V to paste the clipboard into Inkscape. If you don’t see your image (or theWindows “swirl”) appear, wait a few seconds and retry the paste. You’ll probably see a tiny copy appear in some odd locationin the Inkscape window, but don’t worry about any of that.        Everything is already selected from the paste, so use Resize Page to Selection (Shift+Control+R) to reset the imagebounding box to match your pasted diagram.        For a sanity check, you can use Zoom &gt; Page (just hit the “5” key) to adjust the scale so the diagram fills the Inkscapewindow.        Use Save-As (Control+Shift+S) to save the document. Since I’m doing this manually anyway, I usually pick a meaningful namethat’s prefixed with whatever abbreviation I’m using for the current document. If you’re trying to fix an existing image, youcan just overwrite the existing file.        If the image was completely missing, you’ll need to edit your Markdown document and insert ![](media/yournewimage.svg)at the correct point in the document.        Don’t forget to add your new (or revised) image to your git commit  I encountered at least one instance (of a PowerPoint slide pasted into a Word document) where the image was persistently mangledwhen I copied it from Word, but came out fine when I pasted it directly from PowerPoint.It’s also totally fine (and sometimes necessary) to individually select garbage that came along for the ride, such as nearby textfrom Word or unwanted slide elements from PowerPoint, and delete them in Inkscape after you pasted the diagram but before you saveit. But, if you make changes like this, remember the select-all, resize-page business – that’s what keeps your finished image fromgetting accidentally clipped or having unnecessary extra white space in it.Going forwardNow that all of your diagrams have been converted to SVG, what do you do if you need to revise them?It appears that Inkscape can probably make whatever edits you might need, but I haven’t used it enough to get a sense of thelearning curve involved. It also wouldn’t surprise me if converted diagrams are not optimal for editing – for example, if alabel such as “this is text” ends up as three unrelated text boxes “this”, “is”, and “text” instead of just one.Being able to edit the SVG files directly, and keeping them under version control in github, are powerful advantages to followingthis approach. How easy this transition will be is an open question.I’d appreciate feedback from others who have traveled down this road!","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"Read summary reviews of some of the common available Markdown editors... Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. For a quick overview, refer to the blog Test Drive with Markdown. It is a simple language to learn as it has limited syntax, so can be applied directly in text rather than using a WYSIWYG interface, however many users find a preview option useful - that is where Markdown editors help.This blog provides a quick overview of several of the markdown editors commonly used by users within DXC - this to help users choose the right one for them. There was also a Global Tech Forum recording that discussed several of these tools in more detail.The editors currently included in this review are:  GitHub  Visual Studio (VS) Code  Notepad++  Atom  Typora  Ghostwriter  Visual StudioAll of these editors are currently available for download at no cost, although Typora is only in beta and may be subject to licensing in the future.Note: If anyone wants to add information about other editors - please feel free to submit your updates through a pull request… that’s what GitHub is all about!GitHubThe GitHub web interface itself includes a built-in editor with a markdown preview feature - as shown below.GitHub - edit viewTo open edit view, navigate to file you want to edit and then click on the Edit this file pencil icon at the top right of the content pane.GitHub - markdown previewTo preview, click on the Preview changes tab at the top left of the content pane.This has limited functionality and no options to customize, e.g., add spell check or lint check, but it is useful when making minor edits as it can make the process much faster. Edits are done online, so there is no need to clone content locally to edit. Watch quick video.Where this approach becomes more problematic, is if you are making more complex changes, as the preview shows both the original text - highlighted with red bar, plus the new edits highlighted with green bar - essentially what is referred to as a ‘diff’. This can be confusing for new users, Additionally, if you have edits that require the addition of new images - these require you to create a local clone, where you would add the image files, commit locally and then push to GitHub.Visual Studio (VS) CodeVS Code is really useful as a markdown editor, especially if you are just learning. It includes the built-in ability to preview markdown, so you validate how your content looks. You can also download extensions for markdown linting (format checks) and spell checks - to help guide you as you build content. There is a also an extension - Markdown PDF that can be downloaded to enable conversion of markdown to PDF or HTML if desired.VS Code - edit viewTo open edit view, navigate to the file you want to edit in the Explorer pane on right and then double-click to open.VS Code - markdown previewTo preview, right-click on the file tab at the top of the content pane and select the Open Preview open from the context menu.VS Code is installed on your desktop (watch quick video, where you can then on markdown files stored locally on your PC. Therefore, you will need to clone a local copy of your GitHub repo to your desktop, to edit GitHub content. To do this, you’ll need to install a GitHub client - e.g., the GitHub Desktop client or a Command Line Interface (CLI) like Git Bash - more info.For beginners, the easiest option is use the GitHub Desktop client to create your local clone. You can configure VS Code as your default editor in the GitHub Desktop client (select File…Options, click on the Advanced tab and update External Editor). So once you have created your clone, you can just click on the Open in Visual Studio Code or select the Repository…Open in Visual Studio Code to launch your content directly in VS Code, so you can immediately start working on updates.For more adventurous users, you use Version Control in VS to interact directly with GitHub from VS Code.Watch quick video.  For more Detailed information on the use of VS Code as a MarkDown Editor, click hereNotepad++Notepad++ doesn’t have built-in ability to preview markdown, but there is a plugin, Markdown Preview++, which enables this feature, plus the ability to convert markdown to PDF or HTML. This can be downloaded or installed directly using the Plugin Manager in Notepad++ (if this was included in the original installation). There are also plugins available for spell check from the Plugin Manager, although this requires post-install configuration, so is more complex than the setup for VS Code. There are no options available for linting.Notepad++ - edit view/previewTo open edit view, select File…Open from the menu, navigate to file you want to edit in the open file dialog and then click Open. To enable the preview panel, select Plugins…MarkdownViewer++…MarkdownViewer++ from the menu.Notepad++ is installed on your desktop, where you can then on markdown files stored locally on your PC.

To do this, you’ll need to install a GitHub client - e.g., the GitHub Desktop client or a Command Line Interface (CLI) like Git Bash - more info. Notepad++ doesn’t integrate directly with either of these options, but can be used in conjunction with these tools.AtomAtom is also a useful markdown editor. It includes the built-in ability to preview markdown and spell check, so you validate how your content looks. You can also download extensions for markdown linting (format checks) - to help guide you as you build content. There is a also an extension - Markdown PDF that can be downloaded to enable conversion of markdown to PDF or HTML if desired.Atom - edit view/previewTo open edit view, navigate to file you want to edit in the left pane and then double-click to open.

It is currently in beta version, and is at the moment available for free download. it includes the ability to preview markdown and spell check as built in features. It does not support linting. It does have the ability to convert to other formats, such as PDF, but this requires the installation of Pandoc. It is probably the closet in terms of user experience to Word, which may make it attractive to users, but this has it disadvantages. Typora supports more formatting options than are supported in markdown, it embeds html syntax for more complex formatting, which may not render as expected in all solutions.I have not included screen shots because I was unable to complete the install.Typora is installed on your desktop, where you can then on markdown files stored locally on your PC.

Typora doesn’t integrate directly with either of these options, but can be used in conjunction with these tools.GhostwriterGhostwriter is a distraction free markdown editor that is fairly full featured and specialized as a markdown editor.  Ghostwriter is available on Linux, Mac and Windows and the source for it is available on the public Github here.  Ghostwriter provides a live preview as you type as seen in the screenshot belowIt boasts a full screen mode to take away all distractions when you are writing and spellchecks as you type.  You can drag and drop images to add them into your document from your file manager or use the insert image functionality or just type the image link which if you have forgotten the format is shown in the cheat sheet hub (there are multiple hubs shown in the next image)As additional capabilities Ghostwriter can be themed to your liking and can export your markdown in a variety of different formats as seen in the screen shotVisual StudioVisual Studio may be useful if you are already using it as your development IDE. Use the Markdown editor extension (by Mads Kristensen) along with the Visual Studio Spell Checker extension (by EWSoftware) for a side by side preview with spell check.RecommendationsPersonally, I find the GitHub web interface the easiest tool to use for most updates on existing content and even for creating new content. I am quite comfortable with markdown and find this is sufficient for much of what I do. When I need to do more significant changes, mass file uploads or renames - I use the GitHub Desktop client to manage my clones and then VS Code for editing. I identify myself as more of a business user than technical, so gravitate to tools with a user interface rather than command line.I do not like Typora, as it has more features than I need to create my content and the temptation is to spend more time on format than is needed. I prefer Atom over Notepad++ because I like the integration it has with the GitHub tools. I prefer VS Code over Atom because I find it easier to use.  Added recommendation by Andrew  If you want a full featured easy to use then I would highly recommend ghostwriter especially if you want to actually produce anything that is not going to be created outside of github pages or other static website generation solution.  By the way as you should know recommendations are fairly personal and I detest Atom as an editor and on Linux I will often turn to vim or kate.NotesGitHub client SetupTypically, the GitHub Desktop client is good for most day to day activities. If you are more adventurous you can use the command line client and do everything you need using that.  GitHub desktop client: This can be used to manage commits and synchronize them from the local Git repository to the master repository in GitHub. The client can be downloaded here with more detailed information here. You may need to use your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to authenticate depending on which GitHub instance being used.  Git command line: To use command line, you must install a Git client, such as Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Mac, Linux). This set up will require you to configure SSH authentication. For Windows, download and install the Git Bash client. For Mac, download the Git client here. You’ll also need to run the git config commands to set up your user name and email.","categories": ["Blogs"],

Open ATOM on your Desktop2.  Clone the GitHub Repository:         The First step is to clone the repository you need to work with to our desktop. From the View Menu at the top of the ATOM window, select Command Palette…             From the Command Pallet pop-up, type “clone” to filter to the Git: Clone command:    )        Click the Git: Clone Command to initiate the clone, Paste/type the URL for the GitHub Repository you are working with and select the location/folder on your PC that you want as the clone target, then select the “Clone” button to start the clone:       Note: For DXC GitHub, if you are prompted for credentials to authorize your Clone of the remote GitHub Repository, use your GitHub user ID (DXC short name for DXC Github),    but DO NOT enter your password. Because DXC Github uses Multi-Factor Authentication    (MFA), authentication must utilize a personal access token.     :small_orange_diamond: To create a Personal access token, refer to Creating a personal access    token     :small_orange_diamond: Use the Personal access token instead of your password to authenticate your    Clone access request. Refer to minute 6:50 of the Video Installing VSCode for a demonstration      Be patient, while the interface does not show any activity, it is cloning the repository which might take a few minutes depending on the Repository size, and the network connection. When the clone is complete ATOM will automatically open the cloned repository.        The Cloned Repository is now opened and available for editing within ATOM:     3.  Open Edit Window:      Select the Project from the horizontal tab navigation:           Select/Click at Markdown file from the project to edit to open the file in    an editor pane.  4.  Preview Markdown:      To open a preview of the Markdown file contents there are 2 options:          Select the markdown file to preview and then select Packages from the ATOM top menu and then select Markdown Preview – Toggle Preview         or          Select the markdown file to preview and then select “ctrl+shift+M”.  This provides a preview of the Markdown content that can let you know that your intended formatting is actually implemented.              Any updates to the editor window are automatically visible in the preview window.       5.  Create as PDF:  Markdown PDF extension: to create a PDF document of a Markdown file:          To open a preview of the Markdown file contents there are 2 options:                  Select the markdown file to render as PDF and then select Packages from the ATOM top menu and then select Markdown to PDF – Convert                or                  Select the markdown file to preview and then select “ctrl+shift+C”.                          You should then see this following message:                                                   The resulting PDF version of the file is created in the same folder as the source Markdown file. If you do not want the PDF to become part of the Git Repo, you should copy the PDF to a location outside of the Repository folder and delete the PDF file within the Repository file.      6.  Markdown Lint:      Linting is the action analyzing source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.        With the installation of the linter-markdown extension, this functionality is available for your Markdown content.        To access the lint console, refer to the warnings icon (  ) in the left side of the ATOM footer:            Selecting this icon opens the Lint console with the Lint messages for the    selected Markdown file:         The Lint warnings can be fairly verbose and many of the warnings can be ignored as they will have no impact on the resulting page when presented by GitHub. The Markdown preview should be your primary point of reference when determining if your markdown is correct. It is recommended that you refer to the Lint warnings when you notice the results in the preview are not matching with your expectations.7.  Git Stage, Commit, Publish:   Once changes have been made to files within the repository, these changes need to be staged and committed to the local repo as a change set.  After a Change set has been committed to the local Git, this Change set needs to be published to the Remote GitHub Repository.  This section covers the steps to perform the Stage, Commit and Publish actions:Stage updates:  After your updates have been completed, you can identify any changes you wish to keep by Staging the affected files      The number in brackets beside the Git Menu icon on the bottom-right menu of the ATOM footer indicates the number of files that have been modified and saved, but not yet committed to the local Git Repo:      The task for this section are performed via the Git/Github panels of the ATOM editor. If the Git / GitHub panel is not visible you can expose this panel via one of the 3 following options:          Select the “Git” icon in the bottom-right of the ATOM footer:or      Select Packages from the ATOM Top navigation, then select “GitHub – Toggle Git tab”: or      Select the Key sequence “Ctrl+Shift+9”.            The Git Menu Item shows the set of files that have been changed:          ”You can select modified/added files to be Stage either individually or in    total :            For this demo we select the “Stage All Changes” which selects all modified files and sets them as Staged for commit. To commit this changes to the Local Git repository, you need to enter a Commit message and select the Commit check mark icon:         Now that the Changes have been Committed to the local Repo, the change set needs to be Published which moves the change to the Remote Github repository. To Publish, Select the Publish icon that now shows in the Git section (right side) of the ATOM footer:       Selecting either approach for Publishing will push the local Commits to the Remote GitHub RepositoryReferencesVideo for this discussion: (Document as Code Editors)[http://google.com/]ATOM References:  Install Local Git  Install ATOM  Recommended ATOM Extensions:          linter-markdown extensions to provide linting for markdown content      markdown-pdf convert markdown-formatted documents to PDF files within Atom.

Any updates to the editor window are automatically visible in the preview window. With the extension Github Markdown Preview installed and active, the use of GitHub Emoji’s (ex. “:smile:”) within markdown content will be visualized in the preview pane: )      6.  Create as PDF:  Markdown PDF extension: to create a PDF document of a Markdown file:                  From the View Menu at the top of the VS Code, select Command Palette…)                    From the Command Pallet pop-up, type “PDF” to filter to the Markdown PDF: Export commands:  )                    Click the Markdown PDF: Export(pdf) command to initiate the creation of the PDF document from the selected Markdown file:)                    The resulting PDF version of the file is created in the same folder as the source Markdown file. If you do not want the PDF to become part of the Git Repo, you should copy the PDF to a location outside of the Repository folder and delete the PDF file within the Repository file.      7.  Markdown Lint:  Linting is the action analyzing source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.  With the installation of the markdownlint extension, this functionality is available for your Markdown content.      To access the lint console, refer to the warnings icon ( ) ) in the left side of the VSCode footer:    )    Selecting this icon opens the Lint console:     )  The Lint warnings can be fairly verbose and many of the warnings can be ignored as they will have no impact on the resulting page when presented by GitHub. The Markdown preview should be your primary point of reference when determining if your markdown is correct. It is recommended that you refer to the Lint warnings when you notice the results in the preview are not matching with your expectations.8.  Git Stage, Commit, Publish:   Once changes have been made to files within the repository, these changes need to be staged and committed to the local repo as a change set.  After a Change set has been committed to the local Git, this Change set needs to be published to the Remote GitHub Repository.  This section covers the steps to perform the Stage, Commit and Publish actions:Stage updates:  After your updates have been completed, you can identify any changes you wish to keep by Staging the affected files      The number in blue circle overlaying the Git Menu Item on your vertical menu shows the number of files that have been changed/added  )        Click on the Git Menu Item to view the set of files that have been changed:  )        You can either select all files to be staged or individually selected files to be updated for Commit”    Stage All Changes    )    Stage “Individual” Changes    )        For this demo we select the “Stage All Changes” which selects all modified files and sets them as Staged for commit. To commit this changes to the Local Git repository, you need to enter a Commit message and select the Commit check mark icon:     )        Now that the Changes have been Committed to the local Repo, the change set needs to be Published which moves the change to the Remote Github repository. To Publish, there are 2 options:    Publish from the Git Pane menu   —    )    Publish from the VSCode Footer menu  —    )    Selecting either approach for Publishing will push the local Commits to the Remote GitHub RepositoryReferencesVideo for this discussion coming soon to : (Let’s Connect Videos)[https://dxc.workplace.com/groups/EDGEConnect/videos/]VSCode References:  Install Local Git  Install Visual Studio  Code  Recommended VSCode Extensions:          Markdown All in One All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more).

        "title": "Presenting is going Digital...",
        "excerpt":"No more PowerPoint - learn more about creating your presentations as code... OverviewPresentations as code is the concept by which slide presentations are rendered from basic text rather than using a proprietary format like PowerPoint.  Why would you care or bother with this?Well - it makes slide content more leverageable – you can define once and reuse without physically replicating that content - making making maintenance mush easier. You can see exactly what has changed between each version of your slides – no more rogue updates. You can automate spell check and even include automated link checks - therefore improving overall quality. The content is more easily searched - within a presentation and also across presentations and other documentation as code.There are multiple benefits, but there is a downside. Presentation as code is a paradigm change - it isn’t as simple as recreating content in one medium, exactly the same way you would in another medium. There may be features available on the proprietary tools that you just cannot recreate ‘as code’ - although, there may be good reasons you wouldn’t want to. Also, there are tools you would need to become comfortable with - this takes time.Presentation as code, won’t be the right solution for everyone, but it will become more prevalent over time and you should consider it, as the benefits may be significant and worth the initial effort.This blog is really targeted as helping you on that journey with a few key tips and tricks.Tip #1 - focus on the contentYou should be doing this anyway - but think carefully about the message you want to communicate and focus on the key points in your slides. Plan out your message, even if its just a few scribbled notes and stick to it. Thinks of ways to communicate that message effectively in easily understood terms.Think about your audience, if they are non-technical, avoid jargon and technical terms, if you have include them, make sure explain them both verbally and in the speakers notes.Tip #2 - less is betterResist the temptation to include everything your in your slides. Too much text on a slide encourages your audience to read the text rather than listen to what you have to say, and in doing so they may miss important parts of the message.Try and limit your slides to 3 or 4 bullets at most. Avoid paragraphs of text. Use images where it makes sense and speak to the image rather than surrounding it with words.If there is information you want to make sure your audience can take away with them and reference after your presentation - include it as speaker notes. These do not need to just be random thoughts you had when you created your presentation - you can make them an integral part of the message.Tip #3 - keep it simpleDon’t get carried away with ‘cool’ features and try to resist the temptation to make your presentation ‘dance’. Both documentation as code and proprietary tools have some level of ability to control transitions, create animation and other widgets. This is fun to play with, but is it always necessary? …If your audience expects fireworks - then use the proprietary solution, but be careful you do not over-shadow your message. Otherwise, keep it simple and focus on clearly articulating what you want your audience to take away from your presentation. Typically you want them to talk about the content and not the dancing bears…Tip #4 - think outside the deckIf you have read all of the above and still feel that you cannot communicate your message simply, then consider creating a blog rather than a presentation. This gives you the option to introduce your topic, explore a few salient areas within this topic and then summarize your message.A blog provides the ability to provide much more context around your topic, in terms of text and images, but it is much less formal than a document, and because they are typically brief, is more easily consumed.SummaryAs you can see, many of the tips and tracks apply to both presentation as code and proprietary solutions like PowerPoint. Often we get lost in the desire to have fun with the widgets or just the need to impress your audience with your animation prowess. This can lead, at best, to more time being spent in the creation of content than is needed, or at worst, your audience completely missing your message.Hopefully, these tips are useful whether you decide to start this journey or not, but I encourage to at least take your socks off and get you feet wet.Check out the presentation below to learn more about js.reveal - presentations as code - and also check out our samples… Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few.

        "excerpt":"Learn more about how you can automate the validation checks and publication of your content... IntroductionIt has to be said - I am more of a business user than a techie. I muddle along and ask a lot of questions. …and yet I have successfully implemented several automation pipelines for our site content and for our templates!I wanted to create this blog to walk through how I did this from my perspective - I apologize in advance to the purists, I shall probably make your eyes roll with my non-technical point of view, but it worked for me, and I am hoping it can get a few more people started on the road to automation.This blog will step through the major activities to get you set up with a documentation-as-code pipeline - assuming you are using one of our template solutions. It may also start you on the path to getting a better understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) - the backbone of a pipeline. The journey isn’t always easy, but boy is it magical when it works…P.S. We’re also planning a series on CI/CD - so watch out for the events in Let’s Connect - if you want to learn more!Why Bother?My favourite question before I start anything new is - why bother? Shiny objects do not interest me. If there is no solid business reason for doing something - typically I don’t bother unless I have to… There are some quite compelling reasons to do this …As you move more towards the type of solution shown in the samples, you open opportunities to automate. This could just be the automation of the publication process, but why not go further. With a pipeline, you now have the option to include quality checks in the publication process.You can be assured that your content is spell-checked, you can ensure that links are validated, not only on publication, but an ongoing basis. No more undiscovered broken links. Format checks can be incorporated - the scope for quality check is vast.What is a pipeline?A pipeline is a beautiful thing - at least when it is working.What you see here is essentially the visualization of a script - the jenkinsfile… That script is split into stages - each stage represents a manual task you would need to complete to validate and/or publish your content. There is usually also a little setup stuff at the beginning to address any prerequisites for completing these tasks. To get a better understanding of what a jenkinsfile is, refer to the Anatomy of a Jenkinsfile blog.The easiest way to get started is to find someone else who has created something already that is working and use that, i.e., within our templates there are working examples that can be leveraged with a few changes. You don’t need to recreate the wheel - inner source the problem…The jenkinsfile, i.e., the script, executes in a tool called Jenkins - this an automation server, so it is good at this. It reads the jenkinsfile and executes the stages and tasks as defined. It executes it within it’s own environment, i.e., it creates a working area where it can check out content, execute validation steps on that content, execute any build tasks needed and then deploy to the specified target.So in the pipeline shown in above image, you can see there are 3 stages in this simple pipeline which is used to publish MkDocs content:  install modules - complete required setup for MkDocs and extract latest content updates from GitHub  build - execute MkDocs build command  publish - execute MkDocs deploy commandWhy do this? It removes the need to create a local environment for MkDocs and manually run these tasks, thus simplifying and speeding up the publication of updates, especially in a team environment. Now, each time an update is committed or merged into the master branch in GitHub, the published site content is automatically refreshed with the latest changes.This is a very simple pipeline, but once you start, you can then add things like validation checks - spell checks, link checks, as shown in the example pipeline below. This is the sample you’ll find in the Our Site Minimal Mistakes template. In this pipeline, you can see one of the validation steps have failed…If you are still confused about pipelines - check out our blog Novices guide to CI/CD - it may help.So how can I do this for myself?There are a few steps included here and it may seem daunting, but once you have this setup for your organization, it will apply to every repository you create in that organization - provided that the repository contains a working jenkinsfile in its root folder. You’ll also find some additional instructions included in each of the templates - MkDocs and Minimal Mistakes.GitHubThe first thing you need to do is to create your environment in GitHub - to have a pipeline, you need to have the content to run it on first. If you want to start playing with your first pipeline - the easiest way is to fork one of our documentation-as-code template repositories. You will need to create an organization first, so you have a place to fork it to. You’ll find information about our templates in this blog.JenkinsNext, you’ll need to get yourself setup in Jenkins. To onboard a new organization you have to edit the file orgJobs.json. When you open the file, click on the edit icon at the top right of the content pane - a fork of the content will be created automatically so you can make your edits.You’ll need to copy the following syntax and append it to the bottom of the file, replacing &lt;owner&gt; with your GitHub ID and &lt;organization name&gt; with the name of your organization.{ \"credential\": \"4c04e0d2-09c6-42f3-b57d-dc91b6d76d50\", \"owner\": \"&lt;owner&gt;\", \"endpoint\": \"https://github.dxc.com/api/v3\", \"organization\": \"&lt;organization name&gt;}Once you have edited the file, you’ll need to commit your changes and submit a pull request to get your updates merged back to the main file. The pipeline will not be enabled until your pull request has been completed - this may take a couple of days.GitHub againLastly, in GitHub, navigate to the root of the organization you created and click on the Settings tab, select Hooks from the left menu and then click Add Webhook on the right hand side. Enter the following information:  Payload URL: https://jenkins.platformdxc.com/github-webhook/  Content Type: application/jsonUnder the triggers section, click Let me select individual events and then scroll down and select the Pushes and Pull requests options. This defines when the jenkinsfile automation will be triggered, i.e., when an update is made in the repository or a pull request is issued.Click Add webhook at the bottom of the screen to save.and more GitHubOptionally, you can also update the settings in GitHub, so that the content in your master branch - where you publish from - is protected. So users must always draft changes in a safe environment, i.e., a different branch or in a fork. Once they are done, they must submit a pull request to get their changes merged back to the master copy for publication.This, in effect, provides an airlock between what is drafted and what has been published. The airlock cam only be opened using the pull request process. You can also, opt to add required reviews, so someone must approve the content prior to merge and also entail that the automated quality checks must be successfully completed prior to merge.To configure these checks, open the repository containing the content, click on the Settings tab and then click on Branches in the left menu. Click Add Rule and then configure the desired options. Click Create at the bottom of the page to save.This is how you protect your content, so rather than setting up alerts that let you know when a build has failed, you do not allow a change to be included if it cannot pass the build process.SummaryThis is quite a lengthy blog, but hopefully it was helpful! If I can do this, so can you. The trick is to find a good starting place and our templates are great for that. Then just try it. There are lots of places you can get help - never be afraid to ask. We are all learning from each other and if you are timid or too afraid of not getting it right the first time - you may get left behind.If you have any questions, there are a couple of good communities where you can post these questions - someone will answer - Let’s Connect and DevOps.If you want to learn more about continuous integration, continuous delivery or DevOps use these links - it may be a little technical and is more focused on application development, but it will get you started. There are also other portals in this site under the Core Concepts menu that are related to these topics - you may find these useful.Lastly, watch out for upcoming events on this topic area!","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Documentation-as-code - Anatomy of a Jenkinsfile",
        "excerpt":"Learn more about the building blocks of a jenkinsfile automation pipeline... IntroductionIn continuation of last week’s blog - Documentation-as-code pipelines, this blog examines the engine of our documentation-as-code pipeline, i.e., the jenkinsfile…What is a jenkinsfile?So what is a jenkinsfile, it is the engine or driving force of the pipeline - that is the script that controls everything in pipeline. The jenkinsfile directs, or if you want to use buzz-words - orchestrates, Jenkins - the automation server, to complete whatever activities are outlined in the jenkinsfile script. This script is usually stored in the root of the GitHub repository to which it applies.A good jenkinsfile is self-contained, in that it includes or references all the steps for successful execution - typically they do not rely on certain plugins or environmental prerequisites being available or require manual intervention. For example, for MkDocs the prerequisite setup required to build and publish an MkDocs site are coded into the script. So when the script is executed, included in the script are the steps to install Python, MkDocs and all the other plugins into the Jenkins temporary workspace - these are required to successfully publish content.A good jenkinsfile is also built using clearly defined stages as shown in the image below. This is the visualization of a simple MkDocs jenkinsfiles as it executes - so you can see there are 3 clearly defined stages - installation (of prerequisites), build and publish. This allows you to track the progress of a pipeline as it runs and easily identify failure points if they arise.Within this blog we will dissect several examples of these documentation-as-code pipelines, so you better understand how they work. This will not be a technical deep-dive into the syntax, but instead a high level overview of the component parts. The details will change based on the code language and technology of your solution, but the high level concepts of stages is relatively consistent - although not all examples contain all stages.All of these examples are working pipelines from within our environment:  Sample 1 if from one of our MkDocs template repositories and is very basic, only addressing the build and publication of the site content. Click here to go to the repository in GitHub.  Sample 2 is from one of our live content sites, which is built using the MkDocs framework, and includes a spell check as well as the build and publication of site content. Click here to go to the repository in GitHub.  Sample 3 if from out main TIPS site, it is a live content site, which is build using the Minimal Mistakes framework, and includes a spell check and HTML (link) check, but does not include publication. Publication for this solution is an integral part of GitHub, so does not need to be explicitly scripted. Click here to go to the repository in GitHub.Sample 1 - MkDocsWe’ll start with the simple pipeline shown in the image above. As we said earlier, this consists of 3 stages - install modules, build and publish - so let’s look at the syntax in the jenkinsfile that underlies that pipeline.Getting StartedAt the top of the script you’ll see some set up stuff - my very technical term…So what this does in this example is essentially define the workspace, i.e., the temporary work area, where the rest of the script can execute - it needs this because it will be pulling data from GitHub, doing something magical to it and spitting static html out the other end to upload to GitHub, i.e., the published version.For this pipeline the agent is defined at the top of the script and is used for all other stages - this is not a requirement for all jenkinsfiles, but makes sense in this context as every stage depends upon the previous stage. You’ll see in another example how it is done differently - where they are no dependencies.pipeline{\t  agent {\t\tdocker{\t\t     image 'python:3.7.2'\t\t     args '-u root:root -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw\"'\t\t     args '-v $WORKSPACE:/tmp/sbapp -u=\"root\" -w /tmp/sbapp'\t\t }\t \t } Stage - install modulesThis is the first stage in the automation and it is where the prerequisites for the second and third stages are installed in the Jenkins temporary workspace. This includes Python and all the MkDocs installs. It also pulls the documentation-as-code source content from the GitHub repository where it is stored, and caches the GitHub credentials that are stored as a global credential in Jenkins - as this information is needed to publish the updates to the GitHub pages.You’ll notice at the top of this stage there is a conditional statement, so this stage is only executed if the conditions are met. In this case, it only runs on content that is targeted to the master branch. This is because we only want to update the published content for updates that are actually committed, pushed or merged to the gold source content, i.e., the master branch in the GitHub repository.Note: If you are re-using (inner sourcing) this jenkinsfile for your purpose, you will need to update the credentials syntax included within this stage with the path for your GitHub repo and also create a new global credential in Jenkins using your GitHub ID and PAT (click here and refer to the section Defining Credentials and Secrets for detailed instructions on setting up credentials in Jenkins).  stages{      stage ('install modules'){         when {\t\tanyOf\t\t{\t\t//we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable\t\tbranch 'master';\t\t//changeRequest target: 'master'\t\t}\t\t}  \t            steps{        sh '''                     python -m pip install --upgrade --ignore-installed pip          pip --version          pip install mkdocs          pip install mkdocs-material          pip install markdown-include          pip install mkdocs-macros-plugin          pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin          apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y git            git config --global credential.helper 'cache'                   '''                 withCredentials([[$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'mkdocs', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD']]){                    sh \"git config --global remote.origin.url https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@github.dxc.com/AET/DocAsCodeSamples-mkdocs.git\"                 }                  }Stage - buildThis section is pretty simple - it executes the mkdocs build command. What this does is generate the static web pages based on the source content from GitHub. This is stored in the workspace as a series of html files that represent the published content.Note: This stage is also subject to the same conditional requirements as the first stage.    }       stage ('build') {              when {\t\tanyOf\t\t{\t\t//we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable\t\tbranch 'master';\t\t}\t\t}             steps{              sh '''                mkdocs build                '''      }    }Stage - publishThis section is also quite simple - it executes the mkdocs gh-deploy --force command. What this does is upload the generated static web pages to the gh-pages branch of your repository GitHub. From here the content is automatically published as GitHub pages by GitHub, as specified in your GitHub pages settings.Note: This stage is also subject to the same conditional requirements as the first stage.    stage ('publish') {\t             when {\t\tanyOf\t\t{\t\t//we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable\t\tbranch 'master';\t\t}\t\t} \t          steps{                            sh \"mkdocs gh-deploy --force\"                }     }  }  // end stagesSample 2 - MkDocs with spellcheckThe next example is also a simple pipeline as shown in the image below. This consists of 2 stages - spell check and build &amp; deploy - as you can see from the syntax in the jenkinsfile that underlies that pipeline.Getting StartedIn this example the prerequisite installs, although basically the same as the previous example are scripted differently. They are not part of the up-front setup, but are included within the specific stage to which they apply. This can be done this way because all the activities relating to that setup are included in that specific stage and there are no cross dependencies for that setup with any other stage.This only thing included at the top is a command to clear out data from previous runs, so this particular build only retains temporary files for the last 10 runs. It is always good to pick up your litter…pipeline{\tagent any\t\t\t//give a hoot—don't pollute!\toptions {    \t\tbuildDiscarder(logRotator(daysToKeepStr: '10', artifactNumToKeepStr: '10'))\t\t    disableConcurrentBuilds()\t\t}Stage - spell checkThis stage contains the syntax to execute the spell check. You see here the agent section is embedded in the stage in this jenkinsfile, whereas it was at the top of the first example. So these prerequisites only apply to this stage. This is also a little different in that the commands for the setup are actually referenced from a file called Dockerfile.mdspell, which is located in the same folder as the jenkinsfile in the GitHub repository. This file contains the setup information for the mdspell check. The syntax for executing the spell check is immediately below.You’ll also notice there is a conditional statement that controls when this stage is triggered. It is more expansive than the earlier example in that it will trigger for changes to the master branch and also any pull requests that have the master branch as the target for the proposed updates.  stages{    stage('Spell Check') {          when {            beforeAgent true                anyOf                {                  //we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable                  branch 'master'                  changeRequest target: 'master'                }              }                              agent {          dockerfile {              filename 'Dockerfile.mdspell'              args '-u=\"root\" -v $WORKSPACE:/srv/jekyll -w /srv/jekyll'              reuseNode true            }          }                    steps {             echo 'Checking spelling...'             sh  '''             mdspell -V             mdspell -n -a -r --en-us --dictionary dicts/en_US-large \"*.md\" \"*/*.md\" \"*/*/*.md\"              '''          }        } //End Stage Spell CheckStage - build and deployThis is doing the equivalent to the separate build and publish stages in the first example. How this one differs is that it too has the agent section embedded within the stage and references an external file, Dockerfile.mkdocs for the prerequisite setup syntax. It has the same information for the credentials - so that is identical to example 1 and it includes both MkDocs commands from the latter 2 stages from the other example.\tstage ('Build and Deploy'){        when {\t\tanyOf\t\t{\t\t//we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable\t\tbranch 'master'\t\tchangeRequest target: 'master'\t\t}\t\t}  \t\tagent {\t\tdockerfile {        filename 'Dockerfile.mkdocs'\t\targs '-u root:root -v \"/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw\"'\t\t args '-v $WORKSPACE:/tmp/sbapp -u=\"root\" -w /tmp/sbapp'\t\t\t}        }\t           steps{         withCredentials([[$class: 'UsernamePasswordMultiBinding', credentialsId: 'mkdocs', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD']]){                    sh \"git config --global remote.origin.url https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@github.dxc.com/AET/achievements.git\"              }  \t\t\tsh '''mkdocs build'''\t\t\tsh '''mkdocs gh-deploy --force'''\t\t\t\t      }    } // End stage build and deploy\t\t      }  // end stagesSample 3 - Minimal Mistakes with spellcheck and html (link) checkThe next example is a more complex pipeline (shown in the image below) consisting of 3 stages - review content, build site and HTML proofer, based on the syntax in the jenkinsfile that underlies that pipeline.Getting StartedIn this example the prerequisite installs are included within the specific stage to which they apply. This can be done this way because, as with the previous example, all the activities relating to that setup are included in that specific stage and there are no cross dependencies for that setup with any other stage.The only thing included at the top of this jenkinsfile are the commands to clear out data from previous runs, so this particular build only retains temporary files for the last 10 runs. There is also some syntax relating to the other checks within this pipeline - FORCE_COLOR relates to the spell check and HTML_HLINK_TIMEOUT changes the default timeout settings for the link check.pipeline {  agent any  triggers {  // Every day at 2:30       cron('30 2 * * *')  }     //give a hoot—don't pollute!\toptions {    \t\tbuildDiscarder(logRotator(daysToKeepStr: '10', artifactNumToKeepStr: '10'))\t\t    disableConcurrentBuilds()\t\t}      environment {            // mdspell uses chalk to color output.            // chalk uses a library called supports-color which auto-detects terminal support.            // this env var will force the library to use color.\t\t\tFORCE_COLOR = \"1\"\t\t\tHTML_HLINK_TIMEOUT = '{\"timeout\":500,\"ssl_verifyhost\":0,\"ssl_verifypeer\":false}'          }Stage - review contentThis stage contains the syntax to execute validation checks. This stage is actually 2 stages, but they are designated to run in parallel. The first one is commented out, but shows how you could do a custom check - e.g., search content for a specific term and fail if it is found. The second check is the spell check. This is configured almost identically to the previous example.You’ll also notice there is a conditional statement that controls when this stage is triggered. It is again more expansive than the first example, in that it will trigger for changes to the master branch and also any pull requests that have the master branch as the target for the proposed updates.  stages {    stage('Review content') {      // The following review elements review the raw content, and do not require the site to be built first      parallel {//        stage('Forbid pDXC acronym') {//          steps {//            script {//              // Forbid pDXC acronym in the documentation//              echo 'Check for pDXC acronym in the documentation...'//              sh 'rm -fR _site'//              def pdxcCount = sh (returnStdout: true, script: 'find . -name \"*.md\" | xargs grep -i \" pdxc[ .,-;:\\\\!\\\\?]\" | wc -l').trim() as Integer//              if (pdxcCount &gt; 0) {//                def pdxcOccurrences = sh (returnStdout: true, script: 'find . -name \"*.md\" | xargs grep -i \" pdxc[ .,-;:\\\\!\\\\?]\"').trim() as String//                error(\"We prefer to use Platform DXC instead of pDXC in the documentation. Please check and correct: $pdxcOccurrences\")//              }//            }//          }//        }        stage('Spell Check') {          when {            beforeAgent true                anyOf                {                  //we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable                  branch 'master';                  changeRequest target: 'master'                }              }                              agent {          dockerfile {              filename 'Dockerfile.mdspell'              args '-u=\"root\" -v $WORKSPACE:/srv/jekyll -w /srv/jekyll'              reuseNode true            }          }                    steps {             echo 'Checking spelling...'             sh  '''             mdspell -V             mdspell -n -a -r --en-us --dictionary dicts/en_US-large \"*.md\" \"*/*.md\" \"*/*/*.md\" \"!_posts/2019-04-10-contribute-to-github.md\"             '''          }        }      }    }Stage - build siteThis section is different than the build stages included in the earlier examples. This is because they were both used for deploying an MkDocs site. This example supports a Minimal Mistakes solution. MkDocs and Minimal Mistakes are both documentation-as-code frameworks, but the underlying technology for each one is different, so the commands you need to use to execute a build are also different. This is a good example of how jenkinsfiles can vary, potentially dramatically, from one technology example to another.This section has the agent section embedded and references the external file Dockerfile.jekyll for the prerequisite setup syntax. It then includes the syntax to build a local version of the published content in the Jenkins workspace, as this is where the html proofer check will execute, i.e., on the built content. This is not being built as precursor to publication, but as a requirement for the link checker. The publication process for this solution is actually build into GitHub and is triggered by the update to the master content itself in GitHub - so there is actually no publication stage in this pipeline.Note: This stage is not subject to the same conditional requirements as the first stage. So for this pipeline, the spell check (previous stage) is executed for all pushes and pull requests relating to updates to the master branch within the related repository. However, the html checker (this stage is a prerequisite for that) is only triggered by changes specifically to the master branch. This was done to limit the number of times the links check was executed, as this site contains 1000’s of links and takes quite some time to complete - so slowed us down. It was not deemed necessary to execute for every proposed change.    // Jekyll takes the raw content and translates it into HTML output that can be published    stage('Build site') {          when {            beforeAgent true                anyOf                {                  //we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable                  branch 'master';                  //changeRequest target: 'master'                }              }                agent {        dockerfile {          filename 'Dockerfile.jekyll'          args '-u=\"root\" -v $WORKSPACE:/srv/jekyll -w /srv/jekyll'          reuseNode true        }      }            steps {        echo 'Building site...'        sh '''        rm -fR _site        bundle install        bundle update        export ASSET_HOST_URL=https://github.dxc.com        bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config_htmlproofer.yml        '''      }    }Stage - HTML prooferThis section is unique in this example, although it could be incorporated into the other examples.This section has the agent section embedded and references the external file Dockerfile.htmlproofer for the prerequisite setup. THere are commands to execute the actual html check. There are several versions of this command that show slightly different syntax. All but the last one are commented out. These are different experiments with the syntax for the html proofer in an effort to find what works best for us.Note: This stage is not subject to the same conditional requirements as the first stage - for the same reasons indicated for the build site stage above.    // This stage reviews the resulting HTML output after the build, so must be run after Jekyll    stage('HTML Proofer') {          when {            beforeAgent true                anyOf                {                  //we only build on PR or master. I.e not stable                  branch 'master';                  //changeRequest target: 'master'                }              }                agent {        dockerfile {          filename 'Dockerfile.htmlproofer'          args '-u=\"root\" -v $WORKSPACE:/srv/jekyll -w /srv/jekyll'          reuseNode true        }      }      steps {        // URL Ignore        // - \"edit/master\" which are used to link back to live GH site to edit the raw Markdown        // - \"issues/new\" which are used to generate new GitHub issues against the repo        // - \"jenkins.platformdxc.com\", due to a CA certificate issue, but it requires authn anyway so wouldn't help to proof        // - \"/apis\", \"/use_cases\" - related to deep permalinks under architecture section, issue #127        echo 'Running HTML Proofer...'        // sh  'htmlproofer --allow-hash-href --empty-alt-ignore  --http-status-ignore \"429\"  --url-ignore /edit\\\\/master/,/issues\\\\/new/,/jenkins.platformdxc.com/,/\\\\/apis$/,/\\\\/use_cases$/ ./_site'        // sh  'htmlproofer --allow-hash-href --only-4xx --empty-alt-ignore  --http-status-ignore \"429\" --url-ignore /edit\\\\/master/,/issues\\\\/new/,/jenkins.platformdxc.com/,/\\\\/apis$/,/\\\\/use_cases$/ ./_site'                sh 'htmlproofer --typhoeus-config ${HTML_HLINK_TIMEOUT} --allow-hash-href --empty-alt-ignore  --http-status-ignore \"429\"  --url-ignore /edit\\\\/master/,/issues\\\\/new/,/jenkins.platformdxc.com/,/\\\\/apis$/,/\\\\/use_cases$/ ./_site'\t      }    }    // end HTML Proofer stage  }}SummarySo we have explored 3 different jenkinsfiles representing 3 quite similar pipelines. The stages represent similar intent, but the actual syntax is different. Like the picture of Lego figures below. There are distinct similarities between each one - arms, legs, heads, faces. All are made from Lego bricks as the component parts, but they are all very different.This demonstrates how, although at the highest level the pipelines may look alike, at the lower levels they may vary significantly based on specific technologies. This is OK, but makes it harder for you to find the right example for what you are trying to achieve…At the highest level, a pipeline should have similar stages - representing the requirements for continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment. Here you see stages for validation checks - continuous integration; build steps - continuous delivery; and publish steps - continuous deployment.The actual stages can be treated as building blocks and often you can include or exclude some blocks without breaking the pipeline, for example you could exclude the spell check or choose to remove it. Some blocks may have dependencies, for the examples above the MkDocs has a dependency that you must build before you can publish. You can also have dependencies for the setup, so in the first example, as the setup applied to all stages - it was defined for the entire script. For the other examples, there was different setup for each stage.You can also have conditionals for each stage, so potentially not all stages are executed in every run - this applied to the last example.Hopefully this started to shed light on the intricacies of a jenkinsfile - there is a distinct and quite steep learning curve if building these from scratch. Hopefully you can search in GitHub and find a working example of what someone else has done that you can replicate. The examples above are all working - so you can use any of these to support your documentation-as-code automation, but make sure you pick the right one for the technology you are using.For Minimal Mistakes there are referenced files you need to replicate in addition to the jenkinsfile - you’ll need to be careful of that or just inner source the entire repository. There are no specific script changes you need to make to the actual syntax. For MkDocs there is a little more work you need to as you need to configure your own credentials in Jenkins and update the jenkinsfile with that information and the path to your GitHub repository.We trying to make this easier , so watch this space - we are working on a pipeline library with different examples for multiple different technologies…!Useful links:  Using a jenkinsfile","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"A brief overview of our journey through documentation-as-code month... OverviewThere are many reasons why you should try documentation-as-code and you have probably heard many others talk about this before. What we wanted to do was to create a series of sessions that starting from the beginning of why and then traveled through different topics that built upon this topic and the previous sessions to help users get started.We decided our focus would be from the business perspective, rather than focus on the technology and the underlying methods. Documentation-as-code is a technical solution that addresses certain business pain points - we wanted to make sure that our business users understood the benefits of why they should potentially adopt these practices. Documentation-as-code at its basis is the concept of treating document content in the same way as you would source code, but as a business user that is not a reason that would make you want to switch - just the thought may be daunting for many…So we started small, with a story about Our Journey to Documentation-as-code and we built up more knowledge with each session - hopefully we were successful in enabling many on these solutions…Why bother with documentation as code?As mentioned, there are many business reasons to consider documentation-as-code solutions, ignoring the coolness factor and the technology, in the session - Why Bother with Documentation-as-code we explored some of these reasons. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. Try it the water’s warmNext we looked at some of the sample templates we have created to show users what documentation-as-code can look like. This included our Web Experience - a template to create a web presence, and our Library Experience - a template to create a content library. These are all inner-sourced in GitHub and are great to quick start your exploration of this topic. There were also a couple of sessions specifically focused on how you can fork these environments and make them your own - Getting Started with Minimal Mistakes - the Web Experience and Getting Started with MkDocs the Library Experience. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. GitHubAs a lot of what we talked about is focused around GitHub - we also has a session to encourage users to become familiar with this tool - even if they do not need to use this in their everyday activities. We created a blog Contributing to GitHub, which was full of typos and was great at encouraging users to looking at content and helping me to fix it - potentially the first contribution they have made in GitHub.There are also 3 quick videos that step you through the easiest ways to contribute to content in GitHub:  Contributing in GitHub for Beginners…  Easy contributing in GitHub (beyond beginners)…  Contributing in GitHub (ascending the curve)…To view all GitHub videos, click here. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. MarkdownIn the third week, we focused on markdown, which is a light-weight markup language. It supports simple takes that can be rendered as basic formatting, but the intention was to have a language that could be equally be read in a simple tool like Notepad or as rendered formatted content. We had sessions on Markdown editors - Markdown Editors Unwrapped and also on a tool that supports easy conversion of Word to Markdown - Writage. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. Presenting is going Digital…Every session we had during this month was also itself created as documentation-as-code - either in the format of a blog and/or a slide presentation. We found this was an interesting exercise - some of the team struggled because they like to make their slides more exciting with lots of animation. This was a great example of how these solutions force you to focus more on the content and message you have, rather than the tools you are using to help you do this… Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. Last, but least not - DevOpsAll the sample templates we have created have functioning DevOps pipelines running in the background. These pipelines incorporate continuous integration and delivery - so included validation checks - spell checks and link checks. They also deal with the publication of the updated content to the delivery platform - very cool. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. Documentation-as-code session libraryHere is the list of the session included in this series with a link to the video recordings:  Session 147 - Keynote and Our Journey to Documentation-as-code: Ted Munger, EDGE Engineering Global SMEs Manager, tells the story of our evolution from Word to Documentation as Code and the reasons we embarked on this journey. We are hoping by telling this story, you can jump start your own expedition.  Session 148 - Documentation-as-code - why bother?: Lucy Sheridan,  Leader of the Global Tooling SMEs Team, talks about the benefits of moving away from more traditional documentation tools and adopting a documentation as code solution.  Global Tech Forum - Contributing in GitHub: Elaine Rojas and Rodrigo Traid from the Global Tooling SMEs team, talks about why we decided to move our content to GitHub and also how GitHub makes easy for you manage your data and allow others to contribute.  Session 149 - Digital Explorer: David Stevens, DXC Distinguished Architect from the DXC Technology Office, provides a demo of the Workspace Analytics update and how an e-book can then be created to provide a summary report/document.  Global Tech Forum - Getting started with MkDocs (Library Experience): MkDocs is a simple option ideal to use as the framework to create a ‘library as code’ and designed to manage content across different topic areas. Lucy Sheridan walks us through the steps on how to replicate this site and add our own content.  Session 150 - Getting started with Minimal Mistakes (Web Experience): Eugenia Bonafede, from the Global Tooling SMEs team, shows how to generate a web site hosted using GitHub pages, based on simple markdown content using Minimal Mistakes template.  Session 151 - Sharing our doc-as-code experience: Andres Migliazzo, PDXC Content Product Owner from Architecture &amp; Engineering, tell us why this team decided to take the Doc As Code journey.  Global Tech Forum - Markdown editors: Mike Keohan and Adrian Rodriguez from the Global Tooling SMEs, talk about some of the most common markdown editors, including Visual Studio Code, Atom and Notepad++. These tools provide a local environment where users can get help formatting their documents with markdown, through previews and automated syntax checks.  Session 152 - Writage - convert Word to markdown: Writage is a Word plugin that allows you to convert and save documents formatted in Word to a basic markdown format. Join Ted Munger from the Global Tooling SMEs, as he shows you how easy it is to use this tool, to quick start your new markdown library.  Session 153 - js-reveal presentations-as-code: js.reveal provides a framework to create interactive slide decks from text-based content - html or markdown. This is really cool - presentations built from text-based content. Graphics and content can be leveraged to support ease of maintenance and ensure consistency. Decks are easily shared, can be printed or saved as PDF for offline reference. There are options for speaker notes, which are versioned, so you can use these to support a review process as well as to define intent of your deck. Join Richelle Tio from the Global Tooling SMEs, as she walks you through how to create your own presentation.  Session 154 - Doc-as-code best practices: If you think about documents, almost all documents are focused on the concept of the printed page, but how many documents actually get printed? Why do we spend so much time and effort building our content around a standard sized sheet of paper, when most of us prefer to consume the content on a screen that is potentially much smaller! Join Ruel Reyes from the Global Tooling SMEs, as he talks about some of best practices for making your documents more easily consumed online and also some tips and tricks for markdown.  Global Tech Forum - Google Analytics: Ever wanted to find out if anyone is actually reading your content and who that is? Analytics can help you focus attention on the most popular content and potentially address areas where usage is low. Join Adrian Rodriguez from the Global Tooling SMEs, as he talks about how you can implement Google Analytics and get more visibility to your audience.  Session 155 - Documentation-as-code pipelines: With a pipeline you can automate how you validate, deploy and publish your content. No longer do you need to rely on manual processes to ensure content is spell-checked, broken links are no longer as issue, content can be published with a simple commit. Join Steve Witkop and Gabriel Berlot from the Global SMEs, as they talk about how to automate and the options available.  Session 156 - Documentation-as-code summary: This is an open session, where we will review what has been covered in the month and answer any questions you might have on any of the content.Documentation-as-code quick video libraryHere is the list of the quick videos included in this series with a link to view them:  Why bother with documentation as code?

        "excerpt":"A summary of our experience Installing Matomo... OverviewIt is great to see your content is available, but how do you know if the content is being consumed, and do you know who is consuming your content.  Being able to track site activity is critical to being able to determine the effectiveness of your content.  To track site activity you have 2 primary frameworks that can be leveraged:  Google Analytics and Matomo (previously called Piwik).  Both packages perform very similar activities, with the major difference being (1) where the metrics data is stored and (2) the resources required to support the analytics environment.This blog concentrates on our experience installing Matomo as an internal service.  For more information on Google Analytics and it’s use as an externally hosted service, refer to the following resources:  Analytics          Google Analytics Introduction      Google Analytics for GitHub Setup Guide      Google Analytics (Tech Forum)      Google Analytics is an externally hosted service that eliminates the need to maintain the service, but the logged transaction data is persisted and analyzed on the external platform.  This may be of concern to some organisations, but risks can be mitigated through conscientious configuration of the data elements that are logged with each transaction.  This can extend to the naming standards used for each page to insure that no hint of page content is reflected in the metrics data.Matomo is an Analytics service that you can install on as internal service to track and report on content usage. If you are concerned that metrics logging information might contain sensitive IP that you do not want hosted externally, Matomo presents an option that allows for full control of the service and the logged transaction data.  This option does come with a cost in the form of the hosting and management resources required to maintain an internal logging service.Why is measurement important?In this area of financial restraint it is important to know whether the actions and material you are making available is having an impact.  When looking to invest in a strategy, how do you know that the ROI justifies the effort and cost.  …Note: \tIf you are tracking metrics for sites hosted on SSL servers, the Matomo server must have an SSL certificate in order allow Matomo resources to be loaded the tracked sites clients:\thttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9533799/why-is-it-not-possible-to-track-an-https-site-from-an-http-piwik-siteMatomo prerequisites:Ref: https://matomo.org/docs/requirements/  To run Matomo (Piwik) your host needs to have the following services installed:      Web server such as Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.    PHP version 5.5.9 or greater    MySQL version 5.5 or greater, or MariaDB    (enabled by default) PHP extension pdo and pdo_mysql, or the mysqli extension.

        "title": "How do you use MS Planner?",
        "excerpt":"Six use cases of MS Planner. Our team has been using Microsoft Planner for a while now, and I am curious how other teams use it.  In one of the MS Planner Office Hours, I brought this topic into the table.  I started off sharing how we’re using it within the Global SMEs Team.  Then I also discovered an unconventional but interesting use case from one of our guests. Here are the use cases we have talked about.Defects Management for SME CentralWe’ve used Planner several times for review and testing of SME Central and TIPs.  In one case, I did the review of SME Central - looking out for broken links, and reviewing the content if it’s up-to-date.  The testing task, I managed outside of Planner since it’s only me who’s doing it.  I would work with two of my colleagues for the fixes, so I created a Planner board and listed the defects as cards.Task Name would refer to how to navigate to the page and the issue. Then I used the Description to add more information about the defect.I then created these buckets to represent the phases of defect fixing:graph LRA[Defects] --&gt; B[Fixing]B --&gt; C[Validation]C --&gt; D[Done]I shared the Planner board with two of my colleagues who will do the fixes.  Each of them took the cards from the Defects bucket, assigned to themselves, then moved it to Fixing when they started working on it.  After the fix, they moved the card to Validation.  It is then my turn to check if the fix is successful.  Then I moved the card to Done when the the fix has resolved the defect.If the fix is not yet completed or the defect description is unclear, we communicate through the comments. If there is no fix needed, I moved the card to “Rejected”Testing for SME Central Migration to GitHubIn another case, the testing for SME Central was done by the team, so we needed to manage the activity in Planner starting from the testing, then to fixes, then validation, then closure.  We created tasks cards and associated them with the Portal page that needs to be tested.Similar to the previous use case, we named the buckets to represent workflow phases.Pages to Test –&gt; Testing Pages –&gt; Open Defects –&gt; Fixing Defects –&gt; Validating Fixes –&gt; Rejected Defects –&gt; Closed DefectsA tester would pick up a card from Pages to Test Bucket, assign it to himself then move it to Testing Pages.  Once done, he sets the status to completed.  For issues found, a new card will be created under “Open Defects”.The card would contain the description of the issue.In some defect cards, we made use of the checklist and attachment.The defect card would then be passed along the next bucket, Fixing Defects, where another person will continue the task.  Once fixed, card will be moved to Validating Fixes, the previous tester would then validate if the fix is successful.  If so, move it to Closed Defects.  If not, communicate with the developer through comments, and move the card between Fixing Defects and Validating Fixes appropriately.  If there’s no need for a fix, the card is moved to Rejected Defects.Tips      It is important to identify how you will breakdown your tasks e.g. into defects, into test items.        Next, if you’re going to use buckets to represent Phases, make sure you tell your team when to move a card from one bucket/phase to another.  You can use this move as a trigger for the next team member to take over, like handing over a task from the tester to the developer.  Building TIPS Site content on GitHubWe migrated EDGE Platform from its previous SharePoint Platform to GitHub as the new site Tooling Information Portals or simply TIPs.  The old content were organized into “Suites” e.g. Application Development, Program and Project Management and “Views” e.g. Oracle Applications View, Mobility View.  When we moved to GitHub, we rationalized our content and aligned it with domains in What We Sell.  So there are new domains that weren’t there before in EDGE Platform. Content in existing domains, need to be updated as well.So we broke down the tasks to the major domains in What We Sell.  We created cards for each domain.  Each team members then assigned the cards to themselves.  The task is to research on that particular domain and find relevant tools, accelerators, trainings or resources, so we can document and add a link to TIPS.We created buckets to represent these phases below.  Since we’re working on GitHub, we’ve incorporated the GitHub workflow as well.graph LRA[Open] --&gt; B[In Progress]B --&gt; C[Pull Request Review]C --&gt; D[Defect Validation]D --&gt; E[Pull Request Approved]E --&gt; F[QA Validation]F --&gt; G[Done]A task owner working on a domain will assign the card to himself and put the card to In Progress.  He then creates a branch from a GitHub repo, add his content, and when done, submit a pull request.  He then moves the card to “Pull Request Review”.  If there are comments or issues on the pull request, the approver will move the card to “Defect Validation”, so issues can be fixed. Approved PRs are then moved to Pull Request Approved, which are ready for QA Validation.  When there are issues with QA validation, the cards are returned to “Defect Validation”, then to Pull Request Review and so on.Again, it is important to properly communicate your phases or your workflow.  What does a bucket represent, when to move cards where?  Here’s how the workflow was communicated to the team.Vacation CalendarOne of our guests in Office Hours shared how they’re using MS Planner with MS Teams.  They added a Planner tab to MS Teams to track team vacations.  They use schedule view for an instant calendar.   Team members just have to create a card to log a planned vacation, add a start date and due date, to schedule the vacation.  They don’t change the status to complete to keep the cards in the “Schedule” (Calendar) View.There’s no built in team/channel calendar for MS Teams yet, so this is a very welcome tip.  It is not a conventional way of using MS Planner for task management, but it does work.  Here’s a mock-up board for illustration.There’s another option of adding a calendar to your channel, by getting the group calendar link from SharePoint and adding a “Website” tab.  You can watch this video tutorial.  But this option would always ask for sign in, unlike the first option where it loads the Planner immediately.Presentation BoardAnother unconventional way that I’ve used Planner is for a presentation.  Last Feb, we’ve created quick video series called 5-5-5 in 5 minutes to re-introduce several tools by covering 3 topics:  5 reasons why users are not using Planner  5 reasons why I like Planner, and  5 top tips and tricksInstead of a presentation slide deck , I used Planner itself to showcase those 15 points.  1 bucket for each topic area listed above.  1 card per reason or tip. Then details added to the description, checklist or comments.You can visit the planner board here and watch the quick video here.Agile Demo BoardsWe’ve also created sample boards to demonstrate how MS Planner can be used for an Agile project.  Watch this video explaining the 2 demo boards.

        "excerpt":"For users that want to learn more about typical DevOps practices, but struggle with jargon. This article is intended for users that want to learn more about typical DevOps practices, but struggle with jargon and abundant technologies.The diagram shown above shows a simple assembly line user story and we will be using this to illustrate and explain the concepts of Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Testing and Continuous Deployment. We will try and draw an analogy between the steps you see in the picture and how a DevOps pipeline essentially strings these together and automates them, therefore speeding up the process and ensuring that all steps are executed successfully or the process is aborted. A DevOps pipeline is used within IT to build software, infrastructure, generate documents or pages, etc., but the concepts have many parallels to how we would create and deliver many different things.Hopefully this is useful for everyone that is confused or fed up with the jargon…In our diagram, we show the process for gathering the component part for a car [step 1], using these to build a car through an assembly line [step 2/4]  and executing some basic quality checks to ensure the products meets specification [step 5]. If the car passes quality control, it is moved to some sort of storage facility [step 6]. From there it can be transported to a car sales dealership [step 7]. At the dealership, a customer test drives this car [step 8]. If it meets the customer’s needs, they buy it [step 9].In this example, if the car fails at either the quality control point [step 3] or the test drive [step 8], the car is found to be not  fit for purpose, i.e., fails the checks - it is rejected and a defect report is sent back to the manufacturer [step 3a/8a].This process basically mirrors the concept of a DevOps pipeline…Continuous IntegrationContinuous Integration is basically the process whereby every time an update is made to content (the components part), a process is triggered automatically. If the content is code, this would typically entail some sort of build process. If this is GitHub pages, this triggers the pages to be refreshed based on the updates made.In our simple analogy, continuous integration is represented with steps 1 thru 6.  Step 1: Here are the component parts needed to build the car being brought together.  Step 2: There is an assembly line where these parts are put together to create a car.  Step 3: The assembled car undergoes quality control checks.  Step 3a: Quality control checks fail - GUESS WHY? A defect report is issued.  Step 4: A fix is applied to the components and the assembly line is repeated.  Step 5: Quality control checks are passed.  Step 6: The product, i.e., car, is moved to the secure storage area to wait for next steps.In a typical continuous integration pipeline, as someone commits/merges content updates to the ‘master’ data in GitHub (i.e., adding/updating components parts to the content control tool) [step 1], this triggers a job in Jenkins (the automation tool). The first step in that job is to compile the content based on the defined steps for that job - this could be building an executable or documentation as code, etc.  [step 2]. We could call that the assembly line… Once the process is completed this triggers quality control checks, e.g., unit tests, code checks, vulnerability scans, spell checks, format checks - what it does depends on what your content is and what you have defined in your job [step 3]. If the checks fail, the process aborts, and a notice is sent back to the component owners to report the issue [step 3a]. Now, a fix needs to be made to the components to resolve this issue, on this commit the job is restarted, i.e., a new car is created [step 4]. If the checks pass [step 5], the process continues with the delivery of the process output (the car) to a storage location. In our diagram, this is the car storage area, for code this is a ‘finished goods repository’ like Artifactory, for documentation as code, this probably is a commit to your approved content area [step 6].Continuous DeliveryContinuous Delivery is basically the name for the process whereby the product of your build process, i.e., the assembly process, is moved from the storage area to some sort of staging area, where it is available for further validation. This is typically some sort of functional testing. For some teams, the testing process is manual, but if a team is also practicing continuous testing, then the process will include the automated execution of these tests, so that the output can be considered ready for ‘production’ if it passes.In our simple analogy, continuous delivery is represented with steps 7 thru 8.  Step 7: The car is transported to a car dealership.  Step 8: A customer takes the car for a test drive.In a typical continuous delivery pipeline, as content is uploaded to the ‘finished goods repository’, a process is triggered to then deploy that output to a staging environment - this could be a testing environment [step 7]. Here, automated tests are triggered to ensure the output is fit for purpose [step 8]. These tests are typically automated functional tests, but can include other testing, e.g., performance tests, capacity tests, operational tests, etc. They could be as simple as some additional integrity checks if looking at documentation as code. These could also include some physical check points that require someone to sign off on delivery. These checks must be successfully completed to proceed to the last stage of this process, if they fail, the process aborts and a notice is sent back to the component owners to report the issue [step 8a].Continuous DeploymentContinuous Deployment is basically the name for the process whereby the product, if it passes all required validation checks, is then automatically pushed to a ‘production’ state.In our simple analogy, continuous deployment is represented with step 9.  Step 9: The car is sold to a very happy customer.In a typical continuous deployment pipeline, as content passes all validation checks, a process is triggered to automatically deploy this output from the ‘finished goods repository’ to the target delivery environment, i.e., production [step 9].SummaryThis story is a simple analogy, but hopefully it helps to put the jargon into context for users that are not familiar with these concepts.In this pipeline, we indicate that all processes are included in the pipeline, i.e., are automated. In reality, the automation can be limited to only the continuous integration steps, to include both continuous integration and delivery, or incorporate the entire process.Watch the quick video.Feedback is welcome and appreciated :).Useful Links  DevOps Dojo Green Belt badge training  DevOps portal  DevOps Central  DevOps on Workplace","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"Mermaid is a tool that allows you to create diagrams from text.  It uses a simple markdown-like language to generate different types of diagrams, i.e. flow charts, sequence diagrams, GANTT charts.   Look at this stuff? Isn’t it neat? Wouldn’t you think my (Doc As Code) collection’s complete?In this blog, I want to introduce you to Mermaid, but not the one from under the sea…Mermaid is a tool that allows you to create diagrams from text.  It uses a simple markdown-like language to generate different types of diagrams, i.e. flow charts, sequence diagrams, GANTT charts, class diagrams (experimental) and Git graph (experimental).If you are looking for alternatives to  expensive and heavy tools like Visio or if you want to switch to documentation as code.  I’ve got gadgets and gizmos aplenty  I’ve got whozits and whatzits galoreOkay, enough with the Little Mermaid references, but just saying that there’s a lot of options like PlantUML, draw.io, but Mermaid so far is our favorite because:  True text-based diagram as code unlike draw.io  It’s javascript so it works great for web and GitHub  No need for a server like in PlantUMLThere are other JavaScript libraries similar to mermaid as well, which you can find here.The tool is available as a standalone for command line and a javascript for website integration.  It was developed by Knut Sveidqvist and contributors in GitHub.  Mermaid was nominated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019).  It is licensed under the MIT License.You can try it out with their live editor. In the editor, you can share the link or export as svg file. Fallback text here for unsupported browsers, of which there are scant few. But let’s back up a bit, why use mermaid? Why diagram-as-code?Break free from licensed and heavy tools such as Visio.  Be able to publish an editable diagram, rather than a flat image or pdf version of your diagram.You also get all the benefits of Documentation as Code, such as collaboration, version tracking and automation.  Check out this blog - Why bother with documentation as code.You may also want to watch and access the presentation from the Tech Forum on Diagram as Code here.So do you wish you could be part of this world?So how do you get hold of the tool?  The fastest way is with the live editor as seen above, you can easily generate quick diagrams from that and save it in a file or share the link.For an offline option, There is an available command line interface Tool which you can look further here.  The tool says it takes a mermaid definition file as input and generates svg/png/pdf file as output.

        "excerpt":"A brief overview of our diagram as code journey... Communication…Language…Label…Relationships…don’t get me wrong, this blog is not about a romantic novel or movie of any kind. Believe it or not, these concepts simply talk about a diagram.LOOK at the graphic below.Did you notice the words or image first?Our brain can easily recognize an image, flow, or sequence than a display of verbose paragraph or text. People love to describe meaning of the words via pictorial representation. This is our way of communicating via common language; we try to explain tough concepts or label relationships even on a complex structure. This is the power of a diagram…Now, we add a little twist. Create diagram as code using a common language and available technology.Sounds challenging? It’s good to try something new and perplexing…Understanding Diagram as CodeBut first, what is diagram as code?Diagram-as-code is the mechanism by which a diagram, e.g., a flow chart or sequence diagram, can be rendered from text-based syntax. This can be useful because it makes the content potentially easier to update, for simple diagrams rather than edit a picture and save as image, you can edit directly, plus you can version exactly what has changed.The ordinary way of creating a “diagram” tells a story in the simplest way possible. Where as, a “code” to create a diagram, gives the flexibility to create a new or change the version of how you tell the story, your way…it’s not complicated as it sounds…Diagram as Code JourneyWith our curious nature, we started our journey with Diagram as Code. A great example would be this basic flowchart created with Mermaid. Notice that the language or syntax used is very simple and once embedded in GitHub pages, it renders effectively. The flow chart can easily be edited online and, there are available references and guides on how to use Mermaid.Flow Diagrammermaid&lt;div class=\"mermaid\"&gt;    graph TD    A--&gt;B    A--&gt;C    A--&gt;Z    A--&gt;Y    B--&gt;Y    Z--&gt;Y    Y--&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;Renders as:    graph TD    A--&gt;B    A--&gt;C    A--&gt;Z    A--&gt;Y    B--&gt;Y    Z--&gt;Y    Y--&gt;AThe full Mermaid Flowchart syntax reference is here.Edit the diagram online with this link.Flow DiagramHere’s another example of a flow diagram for Agile DevOps Assessment.mermaid&lt;div class=\"mermaid\"&gt;graph TB    A(Agile DevOps Assessment)--&gt;B    B{Is there sufficient capability &lt;br&gt; to internally drive Agile &lt;br&gt;and DevOps transformation?}    B --&gt;|Yes|C(Is there an opportunity &lt;br&gt;to increase efficiency &lt;br&gt;through automation?)

If you’re into managing tasks with timeline and completion targets, you may be able to do that, and develop Gantt charts. Check out the full Mermaid Gantt Chart diagrams reference here.Here’s to edit the sample diagram online linkAs exciting as it looks, we’ve discovered some applications done by the other groups in DXC such as the Architecture Office. Here’s a quick look on the AO actual application of Diagram as Code link.Tool OptionsThere appears to be some limitations on the diagram size using Mermaid. We’ll publish a follow up blog on this as we investigate. Here are some tools worth mentioning.Google Plant UML is an open-source tool allowing users to create UML diagrams from a plain text language. Diagram example Katacoda Lab Flow; markdown fileDraw IO is free online diagram software for making flowcharts, process diagrams, org charts, UML, ER and network diagrams. The tool will let you save the diagram as image and embed in your GitHub page. It also gives you an option to get the Google UML syntax of your diagram and paste it in GitHub.Diagram as Code BenefitsRebranding? Reusability? Maintainability? Versioning? Cost effectiveness?Yes, they all describe Diagram as Code. Here are more of the benefits that we’ve seen so far.  Licensed tools and cost: no need to use licensed or proprietary tools which most often is costly.  Versioning: can easily track various changes/versions of the diagram.  Rendering/display: It’s simpler to render diagram from code rather than upload the diagram as image artifact. Codes are embedded, while image needs to be uploaded separately then pulled from your page.  Presentation as Code: The diagrams can be embedded in Presentation as Code.  Automated layout          No need to figure out proper placement of elements. The framework does it for you.      Connectors are drawn automatically based on code      Can easily switch from L-R direction to T-B      Responsive design        Maintenance  -In Visio, diagrams are usually published in picture format, and if you want to update the editable vsdx source file may not always be available.          Changes can be done easily via code rather than to an already laid out diagram.      Rebranding is easier to do.      Diagram as Code in SME Enablement LibraryReady to finally get started? Fork this Mermaid or get more info from SME Enablement Library. We shared our Diagram as Code journey in the Tech Forum session. The session was an open discussion with people sharing their experiences and thoughts on Diagram as Code.Here’s a copy of the Diagram as Code presentation, click here.To watch the Diagram as Code Tech Forum video stream, click here.“A picture (diagram) tells a thousand words”. A simple diagram can easily give meaning and convey relevant information. We can even use diagrams to effectively promote and communicate ideas at work. Diagram as code is a mechanism that can help us achieve all of these. All we need to prepare is Communication(content)…Language(syntax)…Label(description)…Relationships(connection/links), which are the essential elements in creating Diagram as Code.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Agile vs agile",
        "excerpt":"One is a framework, the other is a behavior. We tend to forget sometimes, what difference just one measly letter makes. A simple spelling mistake alone can send out a different vibe and alter what we are trying to communicate.Realize the confusion that might arise if the letter “d” in the word “fined” will be accidentally omitted in a warning sign “Illegally parked cars will be fined”.The massively popular American TV Series, “Friends”, had an episode where they were playing Poker and Phoebe, in an attempt to divert the attention of the players candidly joke about “Joker is poker with a J”.The mere word “agile” alone is no exception. Capitalize the “A” in the word “agile” and it gives birth to two identical terms. Two peas in a pod maybe but essentially, one pertains to a trait and the other a framework. So which one is which?Uppercase AgileUppercase Agile, which is a framework, refers to the iterative and adaptive approach of software development which prioritizes collaboration among cross functional teams and encourages continuous improvement, rapid and flexible response to change.The Manifesto for Agile Software Development Agile Manifesto layouts the 12 guiding principles for this approach and also came up with the 4 core priorities to reap the full value of adopting these practices:Interestingly, Agile framework is gaining wider adoption because it is more streamlined as compared to the structured and plan-driven Waterfall framework. The former employs incremental software development approaches and delivery is often in multiple iterations which allows continuous feedback to adapt to current needs. Comprehensive documentations, contract negotiations, rigid adherence to schedule and even extensive planning are kept to bare minimum to ensure that working software is produced at a short span of time and continuously improve to address requirement changes. This approach normally fosters an environment of collective buy-in and effective communication since the Agile team is most likely to display a high degree of involvement to the development of work product to thrive in this kind of methodology. In the long run, it minimizes the occurrence of having to build a finished product that is no longer useful because of unexpected changes in the requirements during the development phase. As Agile framework is flexible to change and feedback driven, the agile team benefits from higher customer satisfaction of the resulting work product and increased business value.Over the years, organizations that marvels on the Agile competitive edge, aren’t oblivious to the fact that what shapes up the success of Agile today, more than the methodology is the people working closely together. And who are they? They comprised the empowered team that demonstrated agility and commitment within the organization and who took on the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master and Scrum Team. But what does it take to be agile?Lowercase agileBy definition, being agile (lowercase) is being nimble, rapid and flexible. An individual or an organization is said to be agile if they are able to quickly make adjustment to changing circumstances.As the company invests on training their people to lean towards Agile Methodology, their people are likewise slowly making an unconscious effort to modify their behaviour consistent with the Agile values and culture. Within the Agile environment, delivery methods and practices, or even as simple as the use of Agile tools, an individual’s mindset is cultivated to demonstrate agility within themselves and drive effective adoption of this methodology throughout the entire organization.This kind of instrumental learning is akin to a child learning for the first time, how to dance. She will not wake up knowing the drills already and become a dancer overnight. Her journey starts with her parents encouraging her to take up dance lessons, attend trainings and keep up with rehearsal schedules. Her continuous exposure to dancing activities can nurture her innate ability but it is only when she performs in front of the audience that she realizes her fullest potential.An organization’s journey to Agile Methodology in most instances, is spearheaded by company executives who have heavily invested in the future state of their organizations.In my opinion, no one is born agile, but one can be transformed into one. Being agile, nowadays, is one of the most valued assets in a workplace. Hence, it is essential that we ascertain ways to practice becoming one in our everyday lives.Fearless of change is the heart of being agile. The freedom to experiment with new technologies, new methods without unnecessary approvals, complements the ability to make quick decisions and recommend spot-on solutions or quick workarounds. And if all else fails, the ability to bounce back briskly without getting discouraged and losing focus of the problems at hand.There had been a massive increase of companies transforming from legacy to Agile and the numbers don’t lie. Agile, indeed has come of age. The Agile framework and the agile mindset or behaviour do not necessarily need to co exist at all times. An organization may comprise of agile team members that are implementing a different method of delivery and still attain a favorable outcome. However, it is in recognizing the glaring dependency that, while Agile framework has a proven track record, it still goes hand in hand with the ability to exercise agility within the organization for the latter to flourish.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "title": "Azure DevOps, the TFS Evolution",
        "excerpt":"The Microsoft ALM evolution from a tool perspective Azure DevOps, the TFS evolution…At present, everyone should be more familiar with digital and cloud tooling options that we normally use or have used in the past. TFS on Azure Cloud aka “Azure DevOps” is not an exception. This new era of cloud hosted tools brings us several changes, and most of them are very good and welcome, but some changes from my perspective, are not quite so good (specifically the costs of usage)… I suppose you can’t have your cake and eat it too…In comparison to what we used to have, now we have a full spectrum of new features. I remember the old centralized TFS type of repo - having to wait or ask someone if they need to continue working on some specific file, so I can start working on that file. I remember the nightly builds and everyone having to complete their tasks before that build could run, and also, I remember the Configuration Managers waiting to finish the builds so they can take the build results and start working on the deployment to specific environments. Besides and not less, I had never used TFS for Agile Planning.With the latest release of Azure DevOps, we have five main Azure DevOps Services (explained with my words and the link to the details on vendor’s site).Azure DevOps Services  Azure Boards: Commonly used to perform Agile Planning, Kanban boards to track team tasks, bugs and work. Tightly associated with change sets in the repo to have a higher tracking of changes.  Azure Pipelines: Everything needed to perform builds and deployments, that includes DevOps CI/CD to any language, platform, and cloud.  Azure Repos: The old SCM repos now on the cloud and integrated with GitHub. Those can be distributed or centralized.  Azure Test Plans: Allow you to manage your entire testing effort across all your platforms and configurations.  Azure Artifacts: Allows you to apply DevOps best practices to the packages that you develop and maintain.PROS      Azure DevOps is automatically updated to the latest version by the vendor. In other words, we don’t have to do upgrades ourselves each time a new version of the tool comes up.        As this version is cloud hosted, we no longer need to worry about of course of the infrastructure and support; by saying this, I can guarantee that support is excellent. For example, I created three low priority cases and I received the answer on the next six hours by e-mail; I can’t imagine if I had a premier or premium payed support. For more details when you start giving a try, please take a look here to create Azure DevOps support cases.  CONSWe were used to have our own SCM environment hosted by our company and not in the vendor’s cloud. That’s different now, as we are consuming Azure cloud resources we need to pay for them, I would suggest you to take a closer look here, to find more pricing details and not start using it without having that in mind.Azure DevOps VideosBTW, we have several videos about intros to Azure DevOps I’ll suggest to take a look, specifically the ones that show a Demo about Azure Pipelines:  Azure DevOps Overview  Azure DevOps MO CI Configuration  Azure DevOps MO CD ConfigurationWorkplace GroupsOk, I hope you enjoy reading about Azure DevOps and feel comfortable at least to start using it and giving it a try; let’s remember you can ask any questions on our Workplace Groups:  TFS and Azure DevOps  Let’s ConnectIf you have anything to add, feel free to fork this repo and add your updates.

        "title": "Going Agile: Scrum vs Kanban",
        "excerpt":"Going Agile: Scrum vs Kanban Scrum or Kanban?It would be great to understand how these concepts play in the Agile world. But do you really have to choose between Scrum or Kanban to be Agile? Or is it possible to utilize and enjoy the best of both worlds? Before getting into Scrum and Kanban, let us step back a bit and discover the origins of the two widely known methods.Did you know that “Scrum” framework has existed way back 1993? Jeff Sutherland is the co-creator of Scrum which was formalized in 1995 with Ken Schwaber. Sutherland then developed the Scrum Guide and helped write the Agile Manifesto in 2001. They defined Scrum as a framework for developing and sustaining complex products. Ever since, the vast majority of software development companies around the world have been adopting Scrum.Is more than two decades ago seem far? Wait until you find out the time the first Kanban system was invented… Taiichi Ohno aimed to develop a system to optimally control and manage work at every stage for Toyota Automotive company in Japan… This system is now known to be “Kanban”, and this happened in the early 1940’s!Scrum and Kanban frameworks have been proven through time, and they worked. It’s never too late to try and enjoy the benefits these frameworks can give to your team and to the company.To learn more interesting insights, here’s a snippet from Scrum vs Kanban Q&amp;A Session with Sarunas Dargelis, a Lead Agile Coach. Scrum and Kanban:  Both are Lean and Agile.  Both use transparency to drive process improvement.  Both focus on delivering releasable software early and often.  Both are based on self-organizing teams.Sarunas Dargelis was also able to share with us a great comparison of Scrum and Kanban.Some questions to ponder to help you choose the right framework applicable to your team…  Is your team cross functional or not?  What is your work prioritization?  What does your client need?  How can you help improve productivity and quality on your developed products and services?  Which is the best key performance indicator (KPI) or metric applicable to you?Kanban is best for teams which have work / projects with widely varying priorities. A Kanban board is used to track work and to continuously improve flow of work which may be shared by multiple teams or individuals. Whereas, Scrum is best for teams with stable work priorities committed through set intervals called sprints. Sprint backlog is used to track work with defined start and stop dates.Upon learning the benefits of both Scrum and Kanban principles, you may try to think, why not combine both?There’s such a thing called as ScrumBan. It is an application of the Kanban Method to a Scrum Process. Kanban works well when used alongside Scrum or any other Agile method. Basically, Kanban can be applied to visualize and improve the flow of work, regardless of the methods being used to do the work.Scrum and Kanban can go hand-in-hand. It could be a win-win situation when both Scrum and Kanban principles are applied and specific practices to follow are selected.To learn more, watch the video below on Scrum vs Kanban Q&amp;A Session presented by Sarunas Dargelis, a Lead Agile Coach, or click here.We have more exciting Agile principles and discussions during the whole month of September in our Q&amp;A Sessions.

        "title": "My 5 Practical MS Flow Examples",
        "excerpt":"Microsoft Flow can automate a lot of stuff and connect to more than 200 services.  Flow comes with Office 365, you can expect a lot of integrations within O365. But you may ask, what can it actually do? Here a few things that you can do. Microsoft Flow can automate a lot of stuff and connect to more than 200 services.  Flow comes with Office 365, so you can expect a lot of integrations within Microsoft apps, as well as external applications. But you may still ask, what can it actually do?Here a few things that you can do:  Setup Outlook email and notifications          Get emails on Outlook for updates on MS Planner, MS Forms      Forward your mails to MS Teams, Planner or To-Do      Get push notification on your mobile when you receive an email from your boss.

I’ve been playing around with Flow to help me out with my daily tasks and I am excited to share what I found useful for my role. These are simple flows mostly created from templates and are easy to setup.Monitor PKC SharePointAs Global Tooling SMEs, we need to keep abreast with DXC Offerings and the corresponding tools, accelerators, and products associated with them.  So we familiarize ourselves with What We Sell and Product Knowledge Center.I’ve setup a flow to send me emails when a new file has been added to my chosen Domain which actually corresponds to a folder in SharePoint.I also wanted to be notified when there are changes to the PKC Hierarchy, so I created another flow to send me an email if an offering has been added to the hierarchy list.Another flow created to track if an item has been modified.First, I had to do some digging in PKC to look for the right SharePoint library and list to monitor.  Then, I used these templates as the base and made some modification:  Send a customized email when a new file is added  Send a customized email when a new SharePoint list item is added  When an item in a SharePoint list is modified send an emailSave attachments to OneDriveEvery time I receive an attachment in my outlook, it is automatically saved in my OneDrive.  Once in OneDrive, it is easy for me to share the link to MS Teams or MS Planner.  I can also access the files in my mobile without having to search through my Inbox.  You can recreate this by using this out of the box template: Save Office 365 email attachments to OneDrive for BusinessIf you want to control which ones get saved in your OneDrive you can optionally add an approval step.  You can then get approval notification in your mobile app or via email.Additional Planner notificationsI’ve created flows for Planner boards that I want to monitor. Flow posts to our MS Teams channel when a new task has been created in that board.  You may also create another flow to post message for completed tasks. Or you may also modify the action step to send an email instead of posting to Teams.I’ve also tried using daily summary of my Planner tasks, but now that MS To-do is around, I found it more usable.  There are also available templates for email reports which you can further customize.These are the mentioned out-of-the-box templates that you can also try:  Post messages to Microsoft Teams when a new task is created in Planner  Send a digest email of all outstanding Planner tasksCreate MS To-do Tasks from OutlookI wanted to consolidate my tasks in one checklist so I have a better view of all of them.  This means I have to collect my tasks from different sources: Jira which we use for sprint planning, GitHub for pull requests and issues assigned to me, and MS Planner.  MS Planner is already integrated to MS To-do, so that’s one problem down.  However, Flow connectors for Jira and GitHub Enterprise are not available in the DXC tenant.  So I’ve made used of the emails from Jira and GitHub to trigger a Flow to create MS To-do tasks. This time, I tried creating simple flows from blank instead of a template.For the Jira tasks, I used this step as my trigger: When a new email arrives (Outlook).  Then I added filters:  From: devcloud_support@csc.com  Subject: Jira AdministratorThen the action step: Create a Task (To Do) with these parameters:  Subject: same as email subject  Due Date: current day + 14  Start Date: Received Time  Body Content: BodyFor GitHub the steps are similar, but my subject filter is:  From: devcloud_support@csc.com  Subject: [AET/Do note that this means my flow will only work for this GitHub organization only.  If I need to include other organization, I can delete the subject filter, but this will increase my flow runs.I also added a condition step to check that the body contains the text that says I am assigned to the issue or pull request.  Body contains “You are receiving this because you were assigned.”Now, every sprint planning, when Jira tasks are assigned to me, I get notified via email, and Flow creates the tasks for me in MS To-Do.  Same thing goes when a GitHub issue or pull request is assigned to me.Stay up-to-date with posts from MS Flow teamAs Tooling SME, we also need to stay up-to-date with what’s happening on O365 apps such as MS Flow.  So, I setup this template to keep track of Flow blog: Get a push notification with updates from the Flow blog. I added a step to send an email as well.You can also track other blogs if you have the RSS feed link or setup a daily digest to minimize emails.  You can also setup email notifications for Twitter posts on certain keywords or hashtags.Looking for more?If you are looking for more examples, head on over to the Flow Homepage, as Microsoft features 7 template collections, which may spark some ideas like:  12 templates that keep you informed when on the go  12 templates to improve your productivity  11 templates that make software development easierOr you can simply browse the Templates sectionHow about you?

        "title": "DevOps & Agile Spec Sheet Quick View",
        "excerpt":"Understand DevOps and Agile quickly with this side-by-side spec sheet These are the questions that you might have when you are new with DevOps and/or Agile. Our Quick Video Series DevOps Myths and Misunderstandings, specifically the 6th episode - DevOps and Agile are interchangeable, has perfectly summarized and have answered most of these questions. In this article, we will take the thought a step further as we tackle more areas about DevOps and Agile.In this day and age, almost all information you need can be found online. However, although information availability seems infinite, people’s time seems to be inversely proportional with it. Thus requiring an ability to consume information quicker in order to consume more. THis is most probably the reason why several statistical data shows that graphical and tabular presentations are more widely read than the Textual document presentations. I, for one, would rather read an article about the detailed specification sheet of an item, rather than going through long descriptions, when buying a gadget.With this in mind, we are using this approach to give you a quick spec sheet of DevOps and Agile, side-by-side, in order to give you a quicker and clearer way to understand their differences and similarities and then provide you with a conclusion at the end.            Specification Item                              Definition      A framework that refers to the iterative and adaptive approach of software development which prioritizes collaboration among cross functional teams and encourages continuous improvement, rapid and flexible response to change.      A culture that emphasizes the collaboration and communication between apps development and operations and the automation of software delivery and infrastructure changes.              Purpose      Manage complex projects.      Manage end-to-end engineering processes from coding through delivery and improve collaboration across the value stream by developing and automating a continuous integration and delivery pipeline.              Goal      Address the gap between customer needs and development and testing teams.      Break down silos between operations team and development + testing team.              Focus      Providing business value to customers and improving speed to delivery.      Collaboration, speed to delivery and continuous feedback.              Implementation      Within a range of tactical frameworks like a Sprint, SAFe and Scrum.      Through collaboration between cross-functional team to ease the transition from development to deployment, help automate processes and improve transparency for all teams.              Main Task      Constant change.      Constant change, testing and delivery.              Importance      Developing software that provides most value is the most important.      Developing, testing and implementation all are equally important.              Feedback Source      Agile team, Product Owner.      Continuous feedback from all cross-functional teams.              Team skill set      Training whole team to have a wide variety of similar and equal skills.      Spreads the skill set between the development and operation teams but with frequent communication between teams and puts focus on automating and doing everything as code to eliminate as much human intervention as possible.              Advantages      Breaks down silos and barriers and offers shorter development cycle and improved defect detection.      Breaks down silos and barriers and offers and increases the frequency and quality of deployments.      Conclusion:While Agile does not necessarily lead to DevOps, both can cause significant culture shifts within an organization. Agile thinking promotes quick, small and manageable changes that provides most value. DevOps promotes culture of enhanced communication, balancing stability with change and flexibility, and a faster and higher quality of delivery. Choosing to use both theories is an active decision that many industry experts believe can lead to more rational decision making, thus improving the company culture.","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"Overview of Artifactory at DXC, with working examples using different application level package managers IntroWhat is ARTIFACTORY?Artifactory is a Binary Repository Manager product from JFrog.A binary repository plays an important role in service management and is the place where project teams store the outcome of its automated build process in order to provide custom packages that are used to provision compute environments.Artifactory is to application packages what GitHub is to source code &amp; text.Artifactory @DXCThe Artifactory instance that is owned, hosted and managed by DXC.DXC Artifactory is the gold source repository for deployment of any DXC BUILD or Managed DELIVERY projects packaged assets that are to be deployed into any compute environment. (desktops, servers, cloud)DXC Artifactory - cLick hereDXC employees use global pass credentials to access.DXC Build or Managed Delivery Projects utilize Service Accounts to enable uploading and downloading of assets.To learn more about setting up Artifactory Service Account click hereArtifactory @DXC and Application Package ManagersApplication Package Managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates. Many organizations face the ongoing challenge of deploying and supporting various versions of software. Application Package Managers helps organizations to automate and simplify the management of their complex environments.Projects experience a massive reduction in effort, improved speed of deployment, and higher reliability.Here are some of the popular application package managers that are supported by Artifactory @DXC.      Java: jar, ear, war etc has Maven and the official MavenCentral. There are many other package managers that will use the maven binary repository format as well (ivy, gradle etc).        .Net: NuGet for .NET applications and can also be used as a distribution mechanism under windows through systems like Chocolatey. Newer versions of PowerShell can also leverage this to distribute PowerShell modules though the PowerShell gallery of which one could build a local distribution with a binary repository and a repository in NuGet format.        In JavaScript: we have NPM which is one of the most popular.        In python: there is PIP and the official package type  PYPI, which one can create binary repository that will support the format.        Docker is available and can be used in combination with the ones listed above.        Generic is a type of Artifactory repository that supports any type of legacy archive format. ( zip, tar, etc.. )  For a full list of package managers supported by DXC Artifactory click hereBefore using Artifactory @DXCMake sure your project has a:  A source code repository - preferably github.dxc.com account.  An automated build pipeline - preferably using jenkins.platformdxc.com  Your project has identified its preferred application package manager type or types.  Your projects Artifactory.csc.com repo(s) are setup with Service Accounts for each of the preferred package type(s)Useful links to get startedTrainingCurrently that is no DXC Katacoda for Artifactory. But i hear that one is in the works!There is no Saba training available and Skillport has only 6 minutes overview of the commercial cloud product.Currently a good location to start learning about Artifactory @DXC is EDGE-Central - click hereOnboardingThe instructions related to onboarding Artifactory @DXC are locatedhereSupportTo Artifactory @DXC support group use github.dxc.com issues.  So to submit a support requestread the instructions located hereUsing Artifactory @DXCIn this section we will share several automated build examples resulting in the creation and uploading of application packagesinto Artifactory @DXC.Using Artifactory @DXC with Application Package Manager requires basic knowledge of application level package managers.The same commands developers are currently familiar with are used.. the only difference is some basic configuration information to tell your package where to store itself, in this case your projects predefined Artifactory repository that supports the preselected package type.  Maven uses a settings.xml file  NuGet uses a Package.nuspec file  NPM uses .npmrc fileThe final critical key to get the automation magic to work is to add your projects Artifactory repository read/write Service Account to the Jenkins credential vault.Working Examples Pipelines using Artifactory @DXC  Use the table below to find a pipeline that aligns to your project profile: programming language, framework and application level package manager.

        "title": "Professionals and Amateurs: Agile and DevOps Perspective",
        "excerpt":"Understand the difference between professional and amateur thinking towards your job and see a clearer path towards Agile and DevOps This blog will discuss the right attitude to get you ready for the Agile and DevOps shift. It will differentiate the professional and amateur thinking towards your job, and hopefully help you see a clearer path towards Agile and DevOps.The word “amateur” is usually defined as a person who does things as a past time, or maybe lacking experience and competence, on a certain profession or area. While a “professional” is defined as a person who is engaged, and mostly knowledgeable, on a certain area or profession.For me, in relation to our daily job, and for this article’s purposes, let’s simply define “professional” as the person who will do everything necessary to get the job done, while the “amateur” mostly chooses to do only the job that is fun for them.The NBA AnalogyIn the game of basketball, Michael Jordan is considered by many as the GOAT (greatest of all time) because of his multi-dimensional game. He can defend, pass, rebound, he is accurate on free throws (sometimes even with his eyes closed), he is clutch, he can shoot mid-range, three-pointers and definitely can bring home the ball for an athletic lay-up or a slam. Then, if we look at someone like Shaquille O’Neal, who is big, strong and a really unstoppable, dominant player in his prime, we wonder why is he not even in the GOAT conversation? This might already be answered by his former teammate, Kobe Bryant, who has repeatedly stated in interviews that Shaq is too lazy to improve his body and game. Although Shaq can score and defend, he fell short on other aspects of his game. He lacks long shot accuracy and he definitely can’t shoot free throws, which is why “hack-a-shaq” was invented. He sticks to what he is good at, or what is fun for him, and never bothers to venture on improving other aspects of him game, unlike what Jordan did.Guilty of Being an AmateurAt one part of our working life, we probably are guilty of this attitude. We find something that we are really good at and we see ourselves as the highly specialized resource on that area, where we feel entitled to work solely for that one specialization only. This approach can be perceived as being more efficient, since you can do things faster and with less to no mistakes. But if you look at the bigger picture of the project, this can actually lead to a reduced output for the team, especially if there are other areas in your project that need more resources and help, while your area of expertise doesn’t really have much work to do.Effects on Software Development TeamAny software development team is prone on demonstrating the difference between professionals and amateurs. There are programmers who don’t enjoy testing. The testers who don’t want to talk to the customers. The Analyst who doesn’t want to work with the developers. The product owner who only wants to think about the new features, but disregards the implementation. The list goes on and you always hear the most common reason flying around – “that’s the other team’s job, not us.”.Unfortunately, this “amateur attitude” won’t help much when you want to go Agile or DevOps. As defined in the DevOps &amp; Agile: Spec Sheet Quick View blog, Agile is framework that refers to the iterative and adaptive approach of software development, which prioritizes collaboration among cross functional teams, and encourages continuous improvement, rapid and flexible response to change. While DevOps is a culture that emphasizes the collaboration and communication between apps development and operations and the automation of software delivery and infrastructure changes. As you may realize, there are common themes here – collaboration, adapting to change and recognizing the values. On any job, there are always good parts and bad parts. The professionals do the full job and not just the fun parts.Professional and Amateur DifferencesFor the purpose of providing an example, let’s dive into the developers’ world where the most common amateur mentality can be traced. There are many factors, like the process, the office environment and organization’s support, which leads to amateur mentality, so this is not the developers’ fault. In a traditional software development organization, for example, the developers are usually in the middle of the flow. Data gathering and designs comes before them, while testing through release comes after, and this creates silos.Amateur developers code exactly what is asked of them, which is not in any way bad, but sometimes is not enough. On the other hand, professional developers see beyond the task. They think about the possible effects of the code to other system in place, how this can provide values, does the requirements have gaps, are there better solutions, and more. This kind of professional thinking leads to collaboration with other teams, like the product owner for example, who can confirm and answers these questions.Probably the most common unwanted situation in a software development team is the gap between the developers and testers. Amateur developers do a bit of testing and usually say, “Coding is my main role, not testing”. Then, when it’s near the end of the sprint and the testers need help to finish in time, the amateur developer would rather start coding the next features, which is more fun for them, rather than take on some testing tasks. After all, they are at their best when writing codes. Amateurs can write code that are asked of them perfectly, however, their sense of responsibility ends there. Amateurs do not worry if the code they’ve written will be useful or adds value. As long as they’ve done their job, it doesn’t matter if no users benefit from their work.In contrast, Professionals do not think like that. Professionals tend to see the big picture and worry about the team, the customers and the end game. Although not their best suit, and potentially difficult for them at time, the professionals are willing to do testing, or any other team functions for that matter, when needed. Professionals do not equate finishing code writing to a success yet. A professional knows that ultimately his job is to do whatever it takes to help the team. Often, that means taking the time to have conversations about the tasks at hand, cross other team functions, and taking on some of the less desirable parts of the work. This type of professional thinking is a great foundation when going Agile and DevOps. It promotes many basic principles of Agile and DevOps like customer-centric thinking, taking an end-to-end responsibility, end in mind approach, and most importantly, breaking silos by being willing to be a cross-functional resource that can ultimately lead to a cross-functional team formation.Agile and DevOps Are for ProfessionalsIf we are striving to adapt to DevOps and become agile, we should shred our amateur way of thinking and learn to step out of our comfort zone. Strong connection, relationships and collaboration among different groups is a good start, but you’ll need to take it further. You must be willing to drop the idea of the traditional horizontal teams where groups like the developers, QA and operations have their own cozy silos. These silos should be broken and the horizontal idea should be converted into a vertical cross-functional teams where each team is responsible for a service and contains people with different skills, such as development, testing and operations skills, and each member cooperates from the start through the end of the project, to create more value for the customers.Think of it this way – if Jordan stuck only with scoring, Pippen only on defending, Kerr only do assists, and  Rodman only rebounds and did nothing else, I don’t think the Chicago Bulls would have won six rings, maybe not even one. But they are all professional and everyone is willing to be a cross-functional player. Everyone improves their game to be able to fill what the team lacks or needs. And with that, they were able to create the most Agile and DevOps team in NBA history – a certified cross-functional championship team.How about you, how do you see yourself now within your team? Are you the multi-dimensional player like Jordan, or the best of just one aspect like Shaq? If you are a Jordan, how have you convinced amateurs to become professionals?","categories": ["Blogs"],

To access the links shown in this video, you can refer to the presentation slide deck at VSCode For GitHub Installing the Essential Components                    VS Code Extensions referenced in this blog:                  ESLint          Markdown All in one          Markdown PDF          HTML Preview          GitLens          GitHub Pull Requests                          This discussion assume you already have a GitHub repo to work with:          If you need to create  a repo to work with, refer to the post Getting started with GitHub and GitHub - Organizations and Repos.        or          Fork an existing Repo into your personal organization, refer to minute 5:50 of the video GitHub - Forks, Clones and Branches.      Editing Files using VSCodeFor details on installing VSCode, dependencies and extensions, Refer to theVideo Installing VS Code      Open VS Code on your Desktop    Clone the GitHub Repository:                  The First step is to clone the repository you need to work with to our desktop. From the View Menu at the top of the VS Code window, select Command Palette…                     From the Command Pallet pop-up, type “clone” to filter to the Git: Clone command:                     Click the Git: Clone Command to initiate the clone, Paste/type the URL for the GitHub Repository you are working with and hit return to start the clone:                    From the file browser pop-up. Select the location on your PC to where you want the GitHub repository cloned (Ex. C:\\Users\\userid\\Source\\GitHub\\organization)                  Note: For DXC GitHub, if you are prompted for credentials to authorize your Clone of the remote GitHub Repository, use your GitHub user ID (DXC short name for DXC Github), but DO NOT enter your password. Because DXC Github uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), authentication must utilize a personal access token.     :small_orange_diamond: To create a Personal access token, refer to Creating a personal access token     :small_orange_diamond: Use the Personal access token instead of your password to authenticate your Clone access request. Refer to minute 6:50 of the Video Installing VS Code for a demonstration                            When the clone is complete you will see a message at the bottom right of your editor window asking: “Would you like to open the cloned repository?”, Select “Open Repository”:                    The Cloned Repository is now opened and available for editing within VSCode:                  Review of the VSCode Vertical Navigation items:    Table 1: VSCode - VSCode Vertical Menu                            Icon          Icon Description                                                Explorer to view the tree structure of the repository contents.

Create a new Development Branch:                  There are 2 ways to create a new GIT branch in VSCode:                  Click on the currently selected branch shown on the VSCode footer bar:                OR                  Select the menu “View” - “Command Palette” (Ctrl+Shift+P), and then type “create branch”:                            Note 1: This will isolate 2 commands, “Create new branch…” and “Create new branch from…”.  Generally you will want the “Create new branch…” command which will create your new branch from the “master” branch.  If you want your branch created from a branch other than the “master” branch, select the “Create new branch from…” command.              Note 2: In either case, it is generally recommended that a descriptive branch name be used.  This might include references to sprint, feature, etc. and use the “/” character as a delimiter (ex. sprint ID/feature ID ).  Use of the “/” character as a delimiter makes it easier to search the branches based on various aspects of the branch name. For simple updates to a stable repo, use user identifier, date and short name (ex. mjk\\20191029-Branch Lifecycle blog).            Open Edit Window:          Select the Explorer (  ) from the Vertical navigation      Select/Click at Markdown file from the project to edit to open the file in an editor pane                      Preview :                              Markdown: (assumes the “Markdown All in one” extension is installed)                          To open a preview of the Markdown file contents, select the Open Preview Icon ( ) ) from the editor pane’s horizontal menu.              This provides a preview of the Markdown content that can let you know that your intended formatting is actually implemented.              Any updates to the markdown content in the editor window are automatically visible in the preview window. With the extension Github Markdown Preview installed and active, the use of GitHub Emoji’s (ex. “:smile:”) within markdown content will be visualized in the preview pane:                                            HTML  (assumes the “HTML Preview” extension is installed)                          As with the Markdown preview, to open a preview of the HTML file contents, select the Open Preview Icon ( ) ) from the editor pane’s horizontal menu:                                          Create as PDF: (assumes the “Markdown PDF” extension is installed)                  Markdown PDF extension: to create a PDF document of a Markdown file:                      From the View Menu at the top of the VS Code, select Command Palette…)                                From the Command Pallet pop-up, type “PDF” to filter to the Markdown PDF: Export commands:  )                    Click the Markdown PDF: Export(pdf) command to initiate the creation of the PDF document from the selected Markdown file:)                          The resulting PDF version of the file is created in the same folder as the source Markdown file. If you do not want the PDF to become part of the Git Repo, you should copy the PDF to a location outside of the Repository folder and delete the PDF file within the Repository file.                            Lint:                  Linting is the action of analyzing source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.                                      Markdown Linting (assumes “Markdown All in one” extension is installed)                          With the installation of the markdownlint extension, this functionality is available for your Markdown content.              To access the lint console, refer to the warnings icon ( ) ) in the left side of the VSCode footer:                               Selecting this icon opens the Lint console:                                    The Lint warnings can be fairly verbose and many of the warnings can be ignored as they will have no impact on the resulting page when presented by GitHub. The Markdown preview should be your primary point of reference when determining if your markdown is correct. It is recommended that you refer to the Lint warnings when you notice the results in the preview are not matching with your expectations.                                                                          JavaScript/TypeScript (assumes “ESLint” extension is installed)                          by install ESLint, you will get the linting information for your JavaScript and Typescript files              Selecting this icon opens the Lint console:  q                                                  Git Stage, Commit, Publish:Once changes have been made to files within the repository, these changes need to be staged and committed to the local repo as a change set.  After a Change set has been committed to the local Git, this Change set needs to be published to the Remote GitHub Repository.  This section covers the steps to perform the Stage, Commit and Publish actions:                  Stage updates:                  After your updates have been completed, you can identify any changes you wish to keep by Staging the affected files          The number in blue circle overlaying the Git Menu Item on your vertical menu shows the number of files that have been changed/added )          Click on the Git Menu Item to view the set of files that have been changed: )                      You can either select all files to be staged or individually selected files to be updated for Commit”                                Stage All Changes            )                                Stage “Individual” Changes            )                                      For this demo we select the “Stage All Changes” which selects all modified files and sets them as Staged for commit. To commit this changes to the Local Git repository, you need to enter a Commit message and select the Commit check mark icon:  )                  Now that the Changes have been Committed to the local Repo, the change set needs to be Published which moves the change to the Remote Github repository. To Publish, there are 2 options:    Publish from the Git Pane menu :    ![](/pages/AET/TIPS-ToolFinder/images/DacEditors/Figure18_VSCode-PublishFromGitPaneMenu.png))          Publish from the VSCode Footer menu :    ![](/pages/AET/TIPS-ToolFinder/images/DacEditors/Figure19_VSCode-PublishFromVSCodeFooterMenu.png))                Selecting either approach for Publishing will push the local Commits to the Remote GitHub Repository            Generate Pull Request (assumes “GitHub Pull Requests” extension is installed)                  Once the changes are committed and published to the Remote GitHub repo, we can create Pull Request to initiate the review process to have the branch changes merged into the master                    select the GitHub Pull Requests (  ) Icon from VSCode’s Vertical menu.                            Create Pull Request                              Select the “+” icon from the GitHub Pull Request Menu to start the creation of a new Pull Request:                          Note: Since the previously created development branch is already selected and visible in the footer, this will be the source for the pull request.  you will be presented with a prompt requesting the target branch for the new Pull Request.  This will be defaulted to master which is the branch we want to target for this demo, but it could easily be a separate branch, such as a sprint development branch.                                                  Complete on Pull Request                  After the Pull Request is created, you are presented with the Description/Conversation for the Pull Request: (  )          If you are a reviewer, you will look at each of the changed files by accessing each of the changed files in the “CHANGES IN PULL REQUEST” section: (  )          As a reviewer, you will normally make a comment and use the “Approve” or “Request Changes” button.                          since we are the creator of the Pull Request, attempts to use the “Approve” button will fail because as the creator of the Pull request, you cannot “Approve” it:(  )              If you are an Admin or Owner of the Repo, you can force a Merge of the Pull Request (even if you were the creator of the Pull Request) by selecting the “Merge Pull Request” button.  In this situation you should still leave a comment to document your reasons.(  )                                                  Delete Development Branch                  Now that your personal development branch has been merged into the “master” branch, this branch can be deleted. You will find there is a “Delete Branch” option/button presented on the Pull Request form after it has been merged:(  )          In selecting the “Delete Branch” button, you are asked if you want to delete both the local (Git) and remote (GitHub) versions of the branch.  You will want to leave these selected and select the “OK” button.                    You have now completed the full Lifecycle for a development Branch.ReferencesVideo for this discussion coming soon to : (Let’s Connect Videos)[https://dxc.workplace.com/groups/EDGEConnect/videos/]VSCode References:  Install Local Git  Install Visual Studio  Code  Recommended VSCode Extensions:          Markdown All in One All you need for Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more).

        "excerpt":"Overview of open source delivery risks and how to beat them Open Source Risks and How to Beat Them - a Quick GuideOpen source software usage presents legal, engineering, and security challenges, and when organizations aren’t on top of the quality of the open source components that they are using, they could unknowingly be incorporating vulnerable, risky, unlicensed, and out-of-date components.In order to ensure the security and compliance of the open source components that you use and ultimately, the solutions that you  ship, you must address the risks that come along with open source software usage.      When are you making sure you are not using problematic licenses?        Do you have a known security vulnerability in your product?    According to The Forrester Wave™: Software Composition Analysis, Q2 2017, “One out of every sixteen open source download requests is for a component with a known vulnerability.”When you don’t manage developers open source usage, you put the project at risk, and you and your organization will likely end up paying for it down the road.Open source components are available on numerous online repositories, and your developers have no way of knowing their level of quality or safety.#1 Open Source Software Security RisksOpen source security vulnerabilities are an extremely lucrative opportunity for hackers. Once discovered by the security research community, open source vulnerabilities and the details on how to carry out the exploit are made public to everyone. This provides hackers with all the information that they need in order to carry out an attack. To make matters worse, since open source usage is so widespread, a vulnerability in a popular open source component provides hackers with many potential victims.Developers put code into the code base without the organization being aware of it, this poses significant risk.This means that finding the risky open source component in your projects as quickly as possible, should be your organization’s top priority as it is in a race against the hackers.Mitigate Open Source Security RisksIn order to mitigate open source risks, developers need to track the open source components that their projects are using, including all their dependencies, while keeping on top of information and updates coming from the open source community.The best way to ensure you are one step ahead of the risks is to incorporate automated tools that continuously track your open source usage and match them up against the most current data about open source components, their vulnerabilities, risks, fixes and updates.Automated open source scanning tools allow you to put your ear on the pulse of the open source community, and keep a constant eye on your open source usage, helping you mitigate the security issues. Below is a link to various examples that employ automation scanning for open source vulnerabilities using tools that are freely available to every DXC Build and Managed Delivery team.AET Pipeline Library Build ExamplesIf your project is using open source and your programming language isn’t in the example library yet; engage with your Account leaders to identify what you can do to mitigate the security risks for your project.#2 Open Source Software Licensing Compliance RisksOrganizations and projects that don’t keep track of their open source licenses are playing with fire, since not complying with the terms of open source licenses is extremely risky business, leaving an organization open to a lawsuit or unknowingly relinquishing the exclusive ownership of the proprietary code.Every open source software component, along with its dependencies, comes with a separate license. When you use an open source component in your project, you are agreeing to a set of terms and conditions that your organization must comply with. This can become murky territory for anyone who is not well versed in the ins and outs of open source licensing.Getting into the nitty gritty of open source licensing is not for the faint of heart. Did you know that there are over 200 types of open source licenses out there, each with its special, specific, and often confusing terms and conditions?So many licenses, so little time in a sprint, makes it extremely challenging to comply with all the legal requirements.Mitigate Open Source License Compliance RisksOpen source may come with legal obligations that go with the usage of that code.In order to mitigate risks associated with open source license compliance risks, you first need to track the open source components that your projects are using, including all their dependencies.The best way to ensure you are compliant is to submit a review requests to the DXC Open Source Review Board for each open source license included in your project.Automated open source reporting tools can provide you with the list of the licenses being used in your project that will require a compliance review.Below are two important links to facilitate a successful open source compliance review.TrainingDXC training about open source software and its usage is located in here.Open Source License Compliance ReviewEvery project that includes open source components in the projects final solution that is packaged and delivered to a client - must register and request an open source license compliance review.DXC Open Source Review linkNotes:      If the open source component is listed on DXC’s white list – your project must still submit a compliance review.        Open source that is not included in the final product delivered to a client are not in scope for reviews.  ","categories": ["Blogs"],

        "excerpt":"While the Flow button is the most accessible way to trigger an instant flow, there are other ways to trigger it.  Learn about 3 other ways to trigger it. Have you heard of button flows?  There are repetitive tasks that you wish to run on-demand instead of being triggered by an event or a cadence.  Here comes instant flow and the Power Automate (Flow) button.  You can create an instant flow and access it with a Flow button.  The so-called button can be accessed anytime anywhere thru the Power Automate (Flow) mobile app. Learn more about button flows from this quick video.This video demonstrates how to create a manually triggered flow and access it in the mobile app with Power Automate buttons.How to trigger an instant flow?While the Flow button is the most accessible way to trigger an instant flow, there are other ways to trigger it.  In this blog, I would like to demonstrate 3 ways:  For a selected item in SharePoint  For a selected file in SharePoint  For a selected file in OneDriveThis means, the above ways would allow you to trigger flows right from SharePoint or OneDrive.  But there are also more advanced ways to trigger instant flows:  HTTP - trigger an event based on a select REST API  HTTP Webhook - create a custom HTTP callback to trigger an action when something happens  When an HTTP request is received  Power AppsHow to create an instant flow?There are 3 ways to create your instant flow.Create from blankFrom the Power Automate app, go to Menu: Create &gt; select Instant flowCreate from templateAs a shortcut, you can select from the template library. Go to menu: Templates. Search for SharePoint (or OneDrive).  From the results find the keyword “instant”.Create from SharePoint or OneDriveYou can go directly to a SharePoint Document Library, or a SharePoint List or a OneDrive Folder, and create the flow from there. Look for the Flow menu button, then click “create a flow”.Sample Instant FlowsI created 3 flows to demonstrate these instant flows. So let’s see each one closer.For a selected item in SharePoint, create a Planner taskI created this in the Flow app with the use of a template.It required me to specify the Site Address and the List Name.  But note that when you will create from the SharePoint Library itself, these information will be pre-filled for you. You will see this in the next sample flow.How to trigger? Go to SharePoint. Navigate to the list.  Select the item, click on Flow from the top Menu.  Then I saw that my newly created flow is one of the options.Or click on more options icon on the item (3 vertical dots )A right side bar will launch, from there I can run the flow.For a selected file in SharePoint, post a message in MS TeamsThis time, let’s see how to create the flow from SharePoint itself.So there’s a side bar on the right that appeared and guided me thru creation of the flow. Then I chose the template from the list “Post a message to Microsoft Teams for a selected file”.I am forwarded to the Power Automate app with the SharePoint and Library information pre-filled for me.How to trigger?  Go to SharePoint. Navigate to  Document Library.  Select the file, click on Flow from the top Menu or the more options (3 dots). I see my newly created flow as an option.On the side bar, I launched my flow, and I was asked what message to post to my MS Teams channel.I proceed with adding my message, clicked on Run flow, then a post was created in my MS Teams channel in seconds.For a selected file in OneDrive, copy as PDFSimilarly this flow can be created thru the Power Automate app or thru OneDrive app directly. I recommend using the OneDrive app, so that the parameters are pre-filled.How to trigger?  Same as in SharePoint, this can be triggered by selecting the file in OneDrive app.  Click on the Flow menu and look for the new flow option.I clicked on the flow, ran it and the new pdf file was created a few seconds after.Learn MoreIf you are new to Power Automate and wished you had an overview first, let me point you to this writeup in the SME Enablement Library.ShareHow have you been using Power Automate?

Our goal - to lower the bar for other teams to create their own GitHub pages…The content is almost identical to the EDGE Engineering site, but differs in that it uses a local copy of the Minimal Mistakes theme and this site has the Jenkins automation enabled to execute spell and link checking on each commit. Users can leverage either site for replication purposes, depending on their needs. This template site has the advantage of the quality checks being run via Jenkins, the other site uses a remote theme, so will automatically be upgraded as the theme is updated.This site has been created specifically to create a light-weight site for the EDGE Engineering content, although the secondary intent is to provide an site that can be easily cloned and tailored for use by other teams. Our goal - to lower the bar for other teams to create their own GitHub pages…The content of this site is described in more detail here. This page outlines what parts of the repo are part of the underlying theme and what is the content that is specific to EDGE Engineering and can be updated/removed when tailoring for your own site.Warning: Users can tailor the theme content, but caution should be taken. The theme supports cross platform access, i.e., PCs, phones, etc., using responsive HTML, so many of the underlying styles are designed to adjust display based on display format, etc. Changing styles can have unexpected consequences.If you just want to contribute to our main site, click here.Required ActionsThe first step for a user wanted to replicate this site is to fork or clone this repo locally. All changes referenced in the tailoring articles would then occur on this copy.This requires updates to the following files in the copy:  config.ymlOptionally, complete the steps to set up a local development environment (recommended for complex changes). This setup may be challenging for some users.Alternatively, if you forked the repo, you can enable pages for the fork to view updates (disable pages when not using). This site was created without creating a local installation of the Jekyll environment, but there are advantages to setting up a local environment to prototype changes prior to commit.Note: This site is setup using Jekyll, for more information, refer here. It uses the Minimal Mistakes theme, which for this site is referenced as a remote theme - meaning most of the theme content is pulled directly from the Minimal Mistakes repo. THe advantage of this is that any updates are automatically pulled into this site. The current disadvantage is that remote themes are currently not supported with the Jenkins automation for spell checker and link checker.Getting Started  Open config.yml for edit  Update following lines          name: (YAML anchor which can be referenced later - I mage it same as title)      description: (specify brief description for your site)      baseurl: (specify the GitHub publication path for your repo including leading slash, e.g., /pages/repopath = /pages/lsheridan2/AEA      repository: (specify the GitHub repo path, e.g., /repopath = lsheridan2/AEA      github: (specify the GitHub repo path for your repo without leading slash, e.g., lsheridan2/AEA)      Workplace: group: (id for your Facebook Workplace group)      PublishTo trigger the publication of GitHub pages for a clone or forked repo, you must update the repo settings. Once it is enabled, the content will be automatically republished when updates are committed to the specified publication branch.To configure GitHub pages:  Click on the Settings tab (immediately below the repo title)  Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and under Source, select the repo branch containing the data you want to publish from. In this site, the content is published from the Master branch, but you can create a gh-pages branch and publish from that if you prefer not to use Master.  Click Save to generate the pages. The GitHub page URL for your site will appear at the top of this section. The page publication may take some time to complete.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Outlines steps to set automated spell and link check using Jenkins      On This Page  Overview  Getting Started          Spell Check      HTML Checker        Our site has the Jenkins automation enabled to execute spell and link checking on each commit. This template site has the advantage of the quality checks being run via Jenkins.OverviewThe CI/CD pipeline is currently running on this site, the job can be viewed here.All pull requests/updates in this repository automatically trigger a new build, which ensures all changes are spell checked and links are verified.  The build fails if errors are found, with details of the specific typos and broken links available through the build console.Getting StartedTo get started you must submit a Jenkins request for the repo or organization where the GitHub page content is located. Detailed instructions on how to submit the request and complete the setup are available [here]https://github.dxc.com/pages/Platform-DXC/devops-jenkins-maintenance/onboard-org.html). These requests are typically processed within a few days.Next, to enable a pipeline for a specific repo, you must ensure that the following files are included in the root of your repo:  .dockerfileignore  Dockerfile.htmlproofer  Dockerfile.jekyll  Dockerfile.mdspell  Jenkinsfile  Makefile  _config_htmlproofer.yml  .spelling  dictsThese can be copied from this repo. Typically, they do not need to be modified if the intent is just to enable the spell and link check for your repo. Once copied, the new job should appear almost immediately in Jenkins.You’ll need to open Platform DXC Jenkins, find the entry that corresponds to your organization/repo in the list on the left hand side and click on that item. You should see the name of your repo where the Jenkinsfile was added in the list that is displayed (see example for this repo here. Click on that to view the job (see example for this repo here and the click on the branch name in subsequent list to view the build status (see example for this repo here.New builds are automatically created when updating content in GitHub and on a nightly basis. Builds can also be triggered manually, by clicking on the Build Now option.The status of the build is indicated by the dot next to the build in the Build History. Blue indicates success, red indicates failure. You’ll also be able to see status in the previous screens denoted by the icon in the lists.To review the build log, click on the build number in the Build History list and then select the Console Output option. You can scroll through the logged data to find the sections for spell check or html check that indicate the errors that caused a build to fail. These must be rectified in order for the build to succeed.Spell CheckSpell check is performed using Markdown Spell Check (mdspell).  A spell checking failure in the pipeline cause a build to fail.  To identify the failure, open the Jenkins pipeline where the failure occurred, scroll to the Spell Check step, and review the error in the output log.The system is currently set to validate against a US English dictionary (as defined in the dicts folder).In general terms, to ignore a word or phrase which is throwing off the spell checker, you add it to the .spelling ignore file.  This will tell mdspell to ignore any and all instances of that word.  This file is case sensitive.Goal: To have as few rows in .spelling as possible. Only add to .spelling when absolutely necessary.When you already have a pull request open from your fork, any additional commits to your fork will trigger another pipeline build on the same PR. In this way, you can keep fixing the spelling until the pipeline passes, which will release the PR for merging.Here are some tips to address spell checking failures:  Have a typo? Fix it!  Proper Names          Some proper names are not recognized. When a new name triggers a spell check failure, add it to the .spelling file in the “Proper Names” section. The value of this is later usage of the person’s name will also then be validated.        Proper Nouns / Vendor Names / Product Names          These should be placed in the .spelling file with the correct vendor spelling and capitalization. This will then (correctly) trigger failure if the incorrect capitalization is used.  (e.g., if JFrog is placed in .spelling, but content is put through the pipeline spelling it with a lowercase F, this will trigger a failure, and is an accurate error which should be fixed because the vendor calls themselves JFrog)        Lowercase vs. capitals          Putting a word in .spelling as only lowercase will allow it to work for both lowercase usage and where the first letter is capitalized. (There is no need to put both Workstream and workstream in the .spelling file.) If however, you want to force only the capital letter version (i.e., proper nouns), use only the one with the capital letter.        Acronyms          All capital letter acronyms (e.g., PDXC) are automatically ignored (mdspell -a). If you have a mixed case acronym (e.g., PoC), you will have to add it to the .spelling file.        URLs          By default, if the URL is properly formatted it should be ignored and not trigger a failure. (http and https already added to the .spelling file) If it does, make sure it begins with http:// or https://. (e.g., using a domain name alone in your content may trigger a spell checking failure)      If you have a spell checking failure you can’t figure out how to fix, open an issue to request help.HTML CheckerLinks that cannot be successfully validated, e.g., result in 404 will cause a build to fail. To identify the failure, open the Jenkins pipeline where the failure occurred, scroll to the HTML Checker step, and review the error in the output log.","categories": [],
